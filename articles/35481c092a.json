Gold Forex Trading Basics If you just started trading, you are probably wondering how to choose a trading time frame. In the todays post, I will go through the common time frames, and explain when to apply them. 1m 5m, 15m Time Frames These 4 t.fs are very rapid and are primarily applied by scalpers . If your goal is to catch quick ebbs and flows within a trading session, that is a perfect selection for you. 30m, 1H Time Frame These 2 are perfectly suited for day traders. Executing the analysis and opening the trades on these time frames, you will be able to catch the moves within a trading day. 4h, Daily Time Frames These time frames are relatively slow . They are mostly applied by swing traders, who aim to trade the moves that last from several days to several weeks. Weekly, Monthly Time Frames These time frames reveal long-term historical perspective and are mostly used by investors and position traders. If your goal is to look for buy hold assets, these time frames will help you to make a reasonable decision. When you are choosing a time frame to trade, consider the following factors 1 - Time Availability How much time dailyweekly are you able to sacrifice on trading? Remember a simple rule lower is the time frame, more time it requires for management. 2 - Risk Tolerance Smaller time frames usually involve higher risk, while longer-term time frames are considered to be more conservative and stable. 3 - Your Trading Goals If you are planning to benefit from short term price fluctuations you should concentrate your attention on lower time frames, while investing and long-term capital accumulation suite for higher time frames. Time frame selection is nuanced and a complex topic. However, I believe that these simple rules and factors will help you to correctly choose the one for you.

Education 1112 by GonzooTrading 2 Golden Cross vs. Death Cross What Do They Really Tell Us? Hello, traders! Its hard to scroll through a crypto newsfeed without spotting a headline screaming about a Golden Cross forming on Bitcoin or warning of an ominous Death Cross approaching. But what do these classic MA signals can really mean? Are they as prophetic as they sound, or is there more nuance to the story? Lets break it down. The Basics What Are Golden and Death Crosses? At their core, both patterns are simple moving average crossovers. They occur when two moving averages typically the 50-day and the 200-day cross paths on a chart. Golden Cross When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, signaling a potential shift from a bearish phase to a bullish trend. Its often seen as a sign of renewed strength and a long-term uptrend. Death Cross When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA, suggesting a possible transition from bullish to bearish, hinting at extended downside pressure. Why They Work and When They Dont In theory, the idea is simple The 50-day MA represents shorter-term sentiment, while the 200-day MA captures longer-term momentum. When short-term price action overtakes long-term averages, its seen as a bullish signal golden cross. When it drops below, its bearish death cross. This highlights a key point moving average crossover signals are inherently delayed. Theyre based on historical data, so they cant predict future price moves in real time. October 2020 Golden Cross On the weekly BTCUSDT chart, we can clearly see a Golden Cross forming in October 2020. The 50-week MA short-term crossed above the 200-week MA long-term, marking the start of Bitcoins explosive rally from around 11,000 to its then all-time high above 60,000 in 2021. This signal aligned with growing institutional interest and the post-halving narrative, reinforcing the bull case. June 2021 Death Cross Just months after Bitcoins peak, a Death Cross emerged around June 2021, near the 35,000 mark. However, this was more of a lagging signal by the time it appeared, the sharp pullback from 60K had already taken place. Interestingly, the market stabilized not long after, with a recovery above 50K later that year, showing that Death Cross signals arent always the end of the story. Mid-2022 Another Death Cross In mid-2022, BTC formed another Death Cross during its prolonged bear market. This one aligned better with the broader trend, as price continued to slide towards 15,000, reflecting macro pressures like tightening monetary policies and the collapse of major players in the crypto space. Early 2024 Golden Cross Comeback The most recent Golden Cross appeared in early 2024, signaling renewed bullish momentum. This crossover preceded a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin above 100,000 by mid-2025, as seen in your chart. While macro factors like ETF approvals or regulatory clarity also played a role, this MA signal coincided with a notable shift in sentiment. Golden Cross Guaranteed Rally, Death Cross Doom While these MA crossovers are clean and appealing, theyre not foolproof. Their lagging nature means they often confirm trends rather than predict them. For example, in June 2021, the Death Cross appeared after much of the selling pressure had already played out. Conversely, in October 2020 and early 2024, the Golden Crosses aligned with genuine upward shifts. Why Care About These Signals? Because they help us contextualize market sentiment. The golden cross and death cross reflect collective trader psychology optimism and fear. But to truly understand them, we need to combine them with volume, market structure, and macro narratives. So, are golden crosses and death crosses reliable signals, or just eye-catching headlines? Your chart tells us both stories sometimes they work, sometimes they mislead. Whats your take? Do you use these MA signals in your trading, or do you prefer other methods? Lets discuss below!

In practice, you panic-sold at support. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. Yogi Berra Welcome to trading where you read about patience and discipline, and then blow up your account chasing a breakout at 3AM. Lets explore the top 10 ways trading theory gets wrecked by real-world execution, complete with painful honesty and maybe a laugh or two because crying is for after market close. ________________________________________ 1. In theory You always follow your trading plan. In practice You make a new plan after every trade. That loss wasnt part of the plan, so obviously the plan was wrong. Lets fix it during the trade in real-time while it bleeds. Genius. ________________________________________ 2. In theory You manage risk carefully. In practice Let me just move the stop... just this once... just 10 more pips... Before you know it, your stop loss is in the next timezone, and your trade is now a long-term investment. ________________________________________ 3. In theory Backtesting proves the strategy works. I n practice Backtest you, alone, with no emotions, clicking replay in TradingView. Live trading markets screaming, Twitter panicking, and you entering on the 1-minute chart because it felt right. ________________________________________ 4. In theory Youll be objective. In practice You saw one green candle and whispered This is it. The reversal. I feel it. You werent objective. You were in a situationship with your trade. ________________________________________ 5. In theory RR 21 minimum. In practice You close at 0.3R just to be safe and then it hits target 10 minutes later while you re-enter worse, and get stopped. ________________________________________ 6. In theory You wait for confirmation. In practice You anticipate confirmation. You hope for confirmation. Spoiler hope is not a strategy. But hey, at least you learned again. ________________________________________ 7. In theory Youre a rules-based, emotionless trader. In practice You meditate, breathe deeply, journal, and then buy Gold after CPI with no stop loss and max leverage. So much for being the Terminator. ________________________________________ 8. In theory More knowledge better performance. I n practice You read five books, memorized all candlestick names, and still entered long into resistance because it looked bullish. Trading isnt trivia night. Its controlled decision-making under fire. ________________________________________ 9. In theory Youll accept losses calmly. In practice First you rage-quit. Then you revenge trade. Then you open ChatGPT and ask Should I hedge this 80 drawdown? ________________________________________ 10. In theory Youll be consistent. In practice You traded London Open on Monday, Asian Session on Tuesday, and New York close on Friday. Consistency? You dont even use the same time frame twice in a row. ________________________________________ So how do you bridge the gap? 1. Journal your trades honestly. Especially the emotional mess-ups. 2. Create rules you can actually follow not Instagram-quote rules. 3. Simulate real conditions including drawdowns, boredom, and fakeouts. 4. Accept that mistakes are part of the job and build for resilience, not perfection. 5. Trade small enough that you dont care much so you can learn while surviving. ________________________________________ Final word Trading theory is like a clean whiteboard. But the market? Its a chaotic toddler with crayons and no rules. If you can operate inside that chaos with clarity and emotional control thats when the theory starts working.

Education by abhirampajj 0 THE CONCEPT OF SUPPORT BECOMING RESISTANCE In the context of forex trading, the concept of support becoming resistance refers to a phenomenon that occurs when a price level that previously acted as a support level for an assets price now switches roles and becomes a resistance level after it has been broken. Heres a more detailed explanation Support Level In forex trading, a support level is a price level at which a currency pair or any other financial instrument tends to find buying interest. This buying interest is strong enough to halt or reverse a downtrend in the price. Traders believe that the assets price is likely to bounce off this support level and move higher, making it an essential point on the price chart. Resistance Level On the other hand, a resistance level is a price level where selling interest is significant enough to prevent the price from rising further. It acts as a barrier that tends to halt or reverse an uptrend in the price. Traders expect the price to bounce off this resistance level and move lower. Support Becoming Resistance The interesting concept comes into play when the price breaks below a previously established support level. When a support level is breached and the price continues to decline, it signifies a shift in market sentiment. The level that was once a support now becomes a resistance level for the price. If the price attempts to rally back up and reach that previous support level, it often faces selling pressure from traders who missed the initial breakdown and now see it as an opportunity to sell at a better price. As a result, the price might struggle to move beyond that level, and it starts acting as a resistance zone.

Real Examples Your Forex broker could be manipulating your trades right now - and you would not even know it. They can rig your charts, trap you in losing trades and steal your money. In this article, I will expose how they do it, I will show you a real example how brokers manipulations can lead to bad trading decisions and significant losses. What Im about to show you will change the way you trade forever, and youll never look at your trading charts the same way again. The story started with a trading live stream in my academy with my students. We spotted a nice setup to trade. We found a strong 4H support on Silver with a confirmed liquidity grab after its test. As a confirmation, we identified a cup handle pattern on an hourly time frame and a breakout of its neckline with a bullish imbalance. When I got my entry signal, I opened my trading terminal to execute the trade. And the way I trade is very specific I use TradingView for chart analysis BUT I have a separate trading terminal for trade execution. When I opened the same setup in my trading terminal, I saw a completely different picture and a strong bearish signal. The broker that I use for technical chart analysis is OANDA , while my trading terminal uses ICMarkets quotes. On the right is the price chart of SILVER with IC. There we can see a valid breakout and a candle close below the support with its consequent retest. From a price action perspective, it is a strong signal to sell . I got a strong feeling that some kind of manipulation is going on here, so I decided to check Silver charts of other brokers. Only the broker that I used for market analysis on TradingView provided a bullish signal, while other brokers had very bearish charts on Silver. It looked very suspicious and felt like OANDA broker was inducing me to buy, knowing that the price is going to drop. So I made a decision not to take a trade. Look what happened then. After a retest of a broken support, Silver dropped sharply. Checking the same trading setup on different brokers charts can help you to avoid the manipulation. My simple decision to examine more charts helped to avoid a losing trade. I strictly recommend you doing the same thing before you place a trade. IF you see a strong deviation of your charts from other brokers, stay alert and vigilant. Probably it is not a good idea to open the trade. Please, support my work with like, thank you!

Support at 3256.73? Resistance at 3352.14? Really? That precise? This kind of fixed-point trading might look good on a chart, but it doesnt work in a real, volatile market especially not in 2025. Ive been trading Gold as my primary asset for over a decade, and if theres one thing experience and logic have consistently shown me, its this you should trade price zones, not fixed points. Let me explain you why. ________________________________________ 1. Gold Is Not a Low-Volatility Asset Gold isnt EURUSD. It doesnt move in clean 20-30-pip increments. Its volatile, reactive, and sensitive to everything from Fed rate rumors to random tweets and global conflicts. Over the past months, volatility has spiked and not just because of economic data. Were seeing Geopolitical uncertainty that escalates and de-escalates overnight Macro shifts in interest rate expectations almost weekly Market sentiment changing faster than ever In this environment, the idea that price will reverse exactly at 3352.14 is pure fantasy. ________________________________________ 2. Percentages Matter More Than Pips Now Back when Gold was around 2000, a 200-pip move meant a 1 change in price. Now, with Gold trading above 3300, the same 1 move is 330 pips. So, if youre still treating 3050 pips like a serious target on Gold, youre not adjusting to reality. Youre chasing crumbs in a storm. Ive written before about why you shouldnt trade Gold for small 3050 pip moves. Its no longer a high-probability game the math doesnt work. Youre either over-leveraging or underperforming. ________________________________________ 3. Price Zones Are Where the Smart Money Trades Markets arent binary. They dont care about your exact number. They care about liquidity zones where enough buyers and sellers are willing to transact in volume. Heres how professionals approach it Support isnt a number its a range. Resistance isnt a line its a battle zone. When you analyze Gold, think in ranges like 32803290 or 33203330. This is where price breathes, traps traders, and makes real moves. Fixed points create unrealistic expectations and false confidence. ________________________________________ 4. Emotion Kills Precision in Real Time In live trading, youre not a machine. Youre a human reacting to candles, tweets, and news. Waiting for an entry at exactly 3352.14 often means You miss the move entirely Or you force a bad entry when price front-runs your level But when you use zones, you give yourself the flexibility to act within context, not dogma. You can read the candle behavior inside that zone, you can spot exhaustion, you can scale in or out you become tactical, not rigid. ________________________________________ Final Thoughts Adapt or Stay Frustrated If you want to trade Gold successfully in this current market, you must adapt Use zones instead of pin-point levels Adjust your expectations to the new pip-to-percentage dynamics Respect the volatility and macro backdrop The traders who will survive are not the ones with the cleanest lines on their charts. Theyre the ones who know how to handle chaos with structure, using zones as flexible tools, not false certainties. Start thinking in ranges, not numbers. Thats where the edge is.

Education by Mihai_Iacob 1 1 2 7 What Is Naked Forex Trading, and How Do Traders Use It? What Is Naked Forex Trading, and How Do Traders Use It? Traders rely on various tools and techniques to trade the forex market. Naked forex trading is one of the oldest and most popular trading approaches among currency traders. This article delves into the details of naked trading, providing insights into its implementation and distinguishing features that set it apart from other analysis techniques. Understanding Naked Forex Trading Naked trading is a trading style that involves analysing markets using a clean price chart, meaning one without technical indicators. Traders who use this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts. Naked trading has its roots in the early days of trading, long before the advent of sophisticated technical analysis tools and indicators. Early traders relied solely on price action and market behaviour to make trading decisions. By stripping away the complexity of modern trading tools, naked trading aims to return to the fundamental principles of trading, emphasising the importance of understanding market psychology and price dynamics. Core Principles of Naked Forex Trading Naked forex trading is based on the following principles - Price action analysis is the foundation of naked trading, focusing on the examination of asset price movements without the help of technical indicators. Traders rely on bar, line, or Japanese candlestick charts to identify patterns, trends, and key support and resistance levels. By concentrating on real-time price movements, traders aim to make their trading decisions based on how prices behave at specific levels. - Naked trading emphasises simplicity and clarity as it removes the clutter of numerous trading tools. This approach helps traders maintain a clear view of the market, making it potentially easier to identify trading opportunities. The simplification also reduces cognitive load, enabling traders to focus on the most critical market movements. - Trader instinct, often referred to as gut feeling or traders intuition, plays a significant role in naked trading. This instinct is honed over time through experience and the extensive observation of price movements and market behaviour. Key Techniques and Tools Mastering price action analysis is crucial in naked trading. These are the four key tools for those who use naked trading. Candlestick Patterns Candlestick patterns play a crucial role in naked trading strategy by providing visual representations of price movements over a specified period. Traders look for different price formations to analyse potential market reversals, continuations, or indecisions. Common candlestick patterns include doji, engulfing patterns, hammer, shooting star, and spinning top. Each offers insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements. Chart Patterns Chart patterns on price charts indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Traders using naked trading techniques rely on chart patterns like flags, rounding topbottom, diamonds, and rectangles to identify key levels where the price is likely to react. These patterns help traders anticipate market movements and plan entry and exit points accordingly. Support and Resistance Levels Support and resistance levels are fundamental concepts in naked trading, representing levels the price struggled to break above resistance or hold above support. Traders identify these levels on price charts to anticipate potential price reversals or breakouts. Support and resistance levels are crucial for setting profit targets, placing stop-loss orders, and managing risk. Trendlines and Channels Trendlines and channels are used by naked traders to visualise the direction and strength of a trend. Trendlines connect successive higher lows uptrend or lower highs downtrend on a price chart, helping traders identify trend reversals or confirm trend continuations. Channels are formed by drawing parallel lines to connect highs and lows, creating a channel in which the price typically moves. Advantages of Naked Forex Trading Naked trading has many advantages therefore, its still used by traders around the globe. Here are the key benefits of naked forex trading - Enhanced Focus and Simplicity This approach removes market clutter as it offers enhanced focus by eliminating complex technical indicators. Without the distraction of multiple indicators that provide lagging signals, traders may respond more effectively to changes in price movements. - Improved Market Understanding By relying on naked trading tools, traders may better understand market behaviour and psychology. Observing price action directly on charts potentially enhances traders ability to interpret market sentiment, identify key support and resistance levels, and anticipate potential trend reversals or continuations. This hands-on approach fosters a deeper understanding of the nuances of the market and improves trading skills over time. - Flexibility and Adaptability Traders are not constrained by specific indicator signals or rigid trading rules. Instead, they can adjust their approach based on real-time price action and evolving market dynamics. This flexibility allows them to take advantage of emerging opportunities and adapt their strategies to potentially mitigate risks. Challenges and Limitations Although naked trading can be effective, it has limitations that a trader considers before relying on this approach. - Learning Curve As naked forex trading relies heavily on interpreting price action without the assistance of technical indicators, traders may need to dedicate considerable time and effort to mastering candlestick patterns, chart analysis, and understanding market psychology. Developing the skill to interpret price movements accurately demands persistence and consistent practice. - Emotional Discipline A notable challenge of naked trading is the absence of clear buy or sell signals provided by indicators, which can lead to heightened emotional responses to market fluctuations. Traders must maintain discipline by adhering to their trading plans, implementing risk management strategies, and avoiding impulsive decisions. - Market Noise Navigating market noise is another hurdle in naked trading. Market noise refers to random price fluctuations that obscure meaningful price patterns. Traders need the patience and experience to distinguish between significant price movements and temporary fluctuations. Practical Application of Naked Forex Trading Setting up a trading plan is essential for implementing naked forex trading. Traders might use the following rules - Define Your Trading Goals Determine your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and period of trading. - Select Currency Pairs Choose currency pairs that align with your trading strategy and offer sufficient liquidity. - Identify Key Trading Times Determine optimal times to trade based on market volatility and your availability. - Establish Entry and Exit Rules Define criteria for entering trades based on price action signals, such as candlestick patterns or supportresistance levels. Similarly, rules for exiting trades should be established to potentially lock in returns or cut losses. - Risk Management Implement risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and calculating position sizes based on your risk tolerance and account size. - Review and Adapt Regularly review your plan to assess its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments based on evolving market conditions and personal trading performance. Real-Life Examples and Case Studies Real-life examples and case studies illustrate how naked forex trading principles are applied in practice Example 1 Trading Support and Resistance A trader identifies a currency pair approaching a key support level on the daily chart. They wait for a bullish reversal candlestick pattern, such as dragonfly doji, to form near the support level. They enter a long trade with a stop-loss below the support level and a profit target at the next resistance level. Example 2 Trend Confirmation A trader observes a currency pair in a strong downtrend on the hourly chart. They wait for a pullback to a trendline and look for a bearish engulfing pattern to confirm the continuation of the downtrend. They enter a sell trade with a tight stop-loss above the trendline. However, it is difficult to determine the profit target as there are no swing lows nearby. The Bottom Line When they understand the naked trading forex strategy, traders may use it in other markets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, its important to note that any analysis does not guarantee effective trading, and other factors should be considered alongside chart analysis. Risk management and a proper mindset are essential for long-term consistency. FAQs What Is Naked Trading in Forex? Naked, or price action trading, is a forex trading approach that involves analysing the market using a clean price chart without any technical indicators. Traders relying on this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts rather than past performance. The strategy emphasises identifying key support and resistance levels, trend reversals, and price corrections purely through the observation of bar, line, or candlestick charts. Can I Trade Without Chart Patterns? Yes, trading without chart patterns may be possible using alternative methods such as indicator-based strategies, quantitative models, fundamental analysis, or sentiment analysis. These approaches allow traders to analyse the markets based on technical indicators, mathematical algorithms, economic data, or market sentiment. What Is a Chart Pattern in a Price Action Strategy? A chart pattern in a price action strategy refers to the specific formations and shapes created by the price movements of an asset, which traders use to analyse future market behaviour. These patterns emerge due to the collective actions of buyers and sellers and can indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Some common chart patterns include triangles suggesting a consolidation before a breakout, Quasimodo indicating a potential trend reversal, and flags signalling the continuation of an existing trend. What Is the 5-3-1 Trading Strategy? The 5-3-1 trading strategy is a disciplined approach designed to help traders focus and improve their trading skills. It involves trading just five currency pairs to reduce complexity and enhance expertise in those markets. Traders then use only three specific strategies to master and consistently apply. Finally, they select one trading timeframe to maintain consistency and avoid confusion. Important At FXOpen UK, Cryptocurrency trading via CFDs is only available to our Professional clients.

Support and resistance levels show where price has reacted strongly in the past. These are zones where many traders including large players have placed buy or sell orders. Support where buyers step in and push price up Resistance where sellers step in and push price down These levels are important because they act like decision zones - Price might bounce from these levels - Or break through and start a new move - Or even fake out traders before reversing again Knowing where these levels are gives you an edge - You can better time your entries and exits - You avoid chasing price in the middle of nowhere - You prepare for market reactions not random guesses Think of them like traffic lights for the market when price hits them, something important usually happens. 2 Three Main Types of Support and Resistance There are 3 key types of support and resistance levels traders commonly use - Level-Based Horizontal zones drawn from key highs and lows - Pattern-Based Supportresistance found in chart patterns like triangles, flags, etc. - Channel-Based Diagonal trendlines showing support and resistance in a channel Today, we focus on level-based support and resistance horizontal lines drawn on key price zones. 3 How to Draw Support and Resistance Levels Use daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes to find major zones. These higher timeframes give you stronger, more respected levels. Look for - Candle bodies that close and open around the same price - Strong wicks rejecting a certain level - Zones where price has bounced multiple times in the past I often pick - The close of a red candle - The open of the next green candle These spots usually show where sellers lost control and buyers stepped in or vice versa. 4 Timeframes and Their Strength The higher the timeframe, the stronger the level - Monthly very strong, long-term zones - Weekly strong and reliable - Daily useful for swing trading - Lower timeframes 15m, 5m more noise, less reliable unless youre day trading or scalping Pick levels based on your strategy - Swing traders use dailyweeklymonthly - Scalpers lower timeframes with extra confluence volume, structure 5 Dont Use SupportResistance Alone Support and resistance are helpful but not enough by themselves. Always combine them with - Market structure higher highslows - Volume confirmation - Indicators or price action signals You want to watch how price reacts at your levels. Wait for confirmation before making decisions. 6 Common Mistakes Traders Make Mistake 1 Drawing too many levels clutters your chart and creates confusion. Mistake 2 Keeping old levels that have already been broken or invalidated. Mistake 3 Ignoring volume. Just because price hits a level doesnt mean it will reverse. You need volume to back the move. Also Dont enter blindly on breakout, breakouts can fail. Wait for confirmation. Dont assume a level is strong just because its touched once look for multiple rejections. 7 Example How I Draw SupportResistance Lets say Im looking at a daily chart. - I find a red candle that closes at 42,000 - Then a green candle opens at 42,000 and pushes higher That tells me buyers stepped in at 42,000 this is a potential support. I draw my horizontal line across that level. Then I zoom into 30m or 15m charts to watch price behavior when it comes back to that level. If price respects it again, I may enter a trade based on the reaction. This technique gives me more confidence and clarity. I know where liquidity might be waiting. I can combine it with indicators or volume tools. I avoid random trades. Summary Identify a timeframe Use the monthly, weekly, or daily chart. Look for two candles Draw your support or resistance line at the point where one candle closes and the next one opens. Make sure the level hasnt been hit yet This helps you spot areas where liquidity grabs might happen. Wait for price to reach the level Once price touches the support or resistance zone, watch how it reacts. After price touches the level, remove it Once tested, that level is no longer fresh and should be cleared from your chart. Support and resistance isnt magic but used with confluence, it becomes a powerful guide. Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE and COMMENT if you enjoy this idea!

Education by Risk_Adj_Return 0 Mastering the ICT Power of 3 concept - How to use it in trading! The financial markets often appear chaotic and unpredictable, but behind the scenes, institutional players operate with clear strategies that shape price action. One such strategy is the ICT Inner Circle Trader Power of 3 model, a framework used to understand and anticipate market cycles through three key phases accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. This guide will break down each of these phases in detail, explaining how smart money operates and how retail traders can align themselves with the true direction of the market. What will be discussed? - The 3 phases - Examples of the PO3 - How to trade the PO3 - Tips for trading the PO3 The 3 phases Accumulation The Accumulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model refers to the initial stage of a market cycle where institutional or smart money participants quietly build their positions. During this time, price typically moves sideways within a tight range, often showing little to no clear direction. This is intentional. The market appears quiet or indecisive, which is designed to confuse retail traders and keep them out of alignment with the real intentions of the markets larger players. In this phase, smart money is not looking to move the market dramatically. Instead, they are focused on accumulating long or short positions without drawing attention. They do this by keeping price contained within a consolidation zone. The idea is to gather enough liquidity, often from unsuspecting retail traders entering early breakout trades or trying to trade the range, before making a more aggressive move. Manipulation The Manipulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the second stage that follows accumulation. This phase is where smart money deliberately moves the market in the opposite direction of their intended move to trigger retail stop losses, induce emotional decisions, and create liquidity. After price has consolidated during accumulation, many retail traders are either already positioned or have orders waiting just outside the range, either stop losses from those trading the range or breakout orders from those anticipating a directional move. The manipulation phase exploits this positioning. Price will often break out of the accumulation range in one direction, appearing to confirm a new trend. This move is designed to look convincing, it might even come with a spike in volume or momentum to draw traders in. However, this breakout is a false move. It doesnt represent the true intention of smart money. Instead, its meant to sweep liquidity, triggering stop losses above or below the range, and then reverse sharply. This stop run provides the liquidity needed for large players to finalize their positions at optimal prices. Once enough liquidity is collected, and retail traders are caught offside, the real move begins. Distribution The Distribution Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the final stage of the cycle, following accumulation and manipulation. This is where the true intention of smart money is revealed, and the market makes a sustained, directional move, either bullish or bearish. Unlike the earlier phases, distribution is marked by clear price expansion, increased volatility, and decisive momentum. After smart money has accumulated positions and shaken out retail traders through manipulation, they have the liquidity and positioning needed to drive the market in their desired direction. The distribution phase is where these positions are distributed into the broader market, meaning, institutions begin to offload their positions into the retail flow that is now chasing the move. Retail traders, seeing the strong trend, often jump in late, providing the liquidity for smart money to exit profitably. This phase is typically what retail traders perceive as the real trend, and in a sense, it is. However, by the time the trend is obvious, smart money has already entered during accumulation and profited from the manipulation. What appears to be a breakout or trend continuation to most retail participants is actually the final leg of the smart moneys strategy. They are now unloading their positions while price continues to expand. Examples of the Power of 3 How to trade the PO3? Start by identifying a clear accumulation range. This typically happens during the Asian session or the early part of the London session. Price moves sideways, forming a consolidation zone. Your job here isnt to trade, but to observe. Draw horizontal lines marking the high and low of the range. These become your key liquidity zones. Next, anticipate the manipulation phase, which usually occurs during the London session or at the NY open. Price will often break out of the range, triggering stop losses above the high or below the low of the accumulation zone. This move is deceptive, it is not the real trend. Do not chase it. Instead, wait for signs of rejection, such as a sharp reversal after the liquidity grab, imbalance filling, or a shift in market structure on a lower timeframe like a 1- or 5-minute chart. Once manipulation has swept liquidity and price starts showing signs of reversing back inside the range or beyond, you now look for a confirmation of the true move, this begins the distribution phase. You enter in the direction opposite of the manipulation move, ideally once price breaks a structure level confirming that smart money has taken control. For example, if price consolidates overnight, fakes a move to the downside running sell stops, and then quickly reverses and breaks above a key swing high, thats your signal that the true move is likely up. Enter after the break and retest of structure, using a tight stop loss below the recent low. Your target should be based on liquidity pools, fair value gaps, or higher-timeframe imbalances. The key to trading the Power of 3 is patience and precision. Youre not trying to catch every move, but to wait for the market to complete its cycle of deception and then ride the clean expansion. Ideally, your entry comes just after manipulation, and you hold through the distributionexpansion phase, taking partials at key liquidity levels along the way. Tips for trading the PO3 1. Learn price movements Before you can effectively apply the ICT Power of 3 strategy, its crucial to have a deep understanding of how price behaves. This means being comfortable identifying market structure, recognizing trend direction, and interpreting candlestick dynamics. Since the Power of 3 is deeply rooted in how price moves in real time, a strong grasp of these basics will give you the confidence to read the market correctly as each phase develops. 2. Analyse multiple timeframes Although the Power of 3 pattern shows up on lower timeframes, relying on just one can lead to misreads. Youll gain a clearer picture when you align the short-term view with higher timeframe structure. For example, what appears to be accumulation on the 15-minute chart may simply be a retracement in a larger trend on the 1-hour or daily. By examining multiple timeframes together, you can better identify the true setup and avoid being tricked by noise. 3. Exercise patience A key part of trading the Power of 3 is knowing when to act, and more importantly, when not to. Its easy to get impatient during the accumulation or manipulation phases, but entering too early often leads to frustration or losses. True discipline comes from waiting for the expansion or distribution phase, when the market reveals its real direction. This is where the most favorable risk-to-reward setups occur.

Gold Forex Trading Basics If you just started trading, you are probably wondering how to choose a trading time frame. In the todays post, I will go through the common time frames, and explain when to apply them. 1m 5m, 15m Time Frames These 4 t.fs are very rapid and are primarily applied by scalpers . If your goal is to catch quick ebbs and flows within a trading session, that is a perfect selection for you. 30m, 1H Time Frame These 2 are perfectly suited for day traders. Executing the analysis and opening the trades on these time frames, you will be able to catch the moves within a trading day. 4h, Daily Time Frames These time frames are relatively slow . They are mostly applied by swing traders, who aim to trade the moves that last from several days to several weeks. Weekly, Monthly Time Frames These time frames reveal long-term historical perspective and are mostly used by investors and position traders. If your goal is to look for buy hold assets, these time frames will help you to make a reasonable decision. When you are choosing a time frame to trade, consider the following factors 1 - Time Availability How much time dailyweekly are you able to sacrifice on trading? Remember a simple rule lower is the time frame, more time it requires for management. 2 - Risk Tolerance Smaller time frames usually involve higher risk, while longer-term time frames are considered to be more conservative and stable. 3 - Your Trading Goals If you are planning to benefit from short term price fluctuations you should concentrate your attention on lower time frames, while investing and long-term capital accumulation suite for higher time frames. Time frame selection is nuanced and a complex topic. However, I believe that these simple rules and factors will help you to correctly choose the one for you.

Education 1112 by GonzooTrading 2 Golden Cross vs. Death Cross What Do They Really Tell Us? Hello, traders! Its hard to scroll through a crypto newsfeed without spotting a headline screaming about a Golden Cross forming on Bitcoin or warning of an ominous Death Cross approaching. But what do these classic MA signals can really mean? Are they as prophetic as they sound, or is there more nuance to the story? Lets break it down. The Basics What Are Golden and Death Crosses? At their core, both patterns are simple moving average crossovers. They occur when two moving averages typically the 50-day and the 200-day cross paths on a chart. Golden Cross When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, signaling a potential shift from a bearish phase to a bullish trend. Its often seen as a sign of renewed strength and a long-term uptrend. Death Cross When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA, suggesting a possible transition from bullish to bearish, hinting at extended downside pressure. Why They Work and When They Dont In theory, the idea is simple The 50-day MA represents shorter-term sentiment, while the 200-day MA captures longer-term momentum. When short-term price action overtakes long-term averages, its seen as a bullish signal golden cross. When it drops below, its bearish death cross. This highlights a key point moving average crossover signals are inherently delayed. Theyre based on historical data, so they cant predict future price moves in real time. October 2020 Golden Cross On the weekly BTCUSDT chart, we can clearly see a Golden Cross forming in October 2020. The 50-week MA short-term crossed above the 200-week MA long-term, marking the start of Bitcoins explosive rally from around 11,000 to its then all-time high above 60,000 in 2021. This signal aligned with growing institutional interest and the post-halving narrative, reinforcing the bull case. June 2021 Death Cross Just months after Bitcoins peak, a Death Cross emerged around June 2021, near the 35,000 mark. However, this was more of a lagging signal by the time it appeared, the sharp pullback from 60K had already taken place. Interestingly, the market stabilized not long after, with a recovery above 50K later that year, showing that Death Cross signals arent always the end of the story. Mid-2022 Another Death Cross In mid-2022, BTC formed another Death Cross during its prolonged bear market. This one aligned better with the broader trend, as price continued to slide towards 15,000, reflecting macro pressures like tightening monetary policies and the collapse of major players in the crypto space. Early 2024 Golden Cross Comeback The most recent Golden Cross appeared in early 2024, signaling renewed bullish momentum. This crossover preceded a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin above 100,000 by mid-2025, as seen in your chart. While macro factors like ETF approvals or regulatory clarity also played a role, this MA signal coincided with a notable shift in sentiment. Golden Cross Guaranteed Rally, Death Cross Doom While these MA crossovers are clean and appealing, theyre not foolproof. Their lagging nature means they often confirm trends rather than predict them. For example, in June 2021, the Death Cross appeared after much of the selling pressure had already played out. Conversely, in October 2020 and early 2024, the Golden Crosses aligned with genuine upward shifts. Why Care About These Signals? Because they help us contextualize market sentiment. The golden cross and death cross reflect collective trader psychology optimism and fear. But to truly understand them, we need to combine them with volume, market structure, and macro narratives. So, are golden crosses and death crosses reliable signals, or just eye-catching headlines? Your chart tells us both stories sometimes they work, sometimes they mislead. Whats your take? Do you use these MA signals in your trading, or do you prefer other methods? Lets discuss below!

In practice, you panic-sold at support. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. Yogi Berra Welcome to trading where you read about patience and discipline, and then blow up your account chasing a breakout at 3AM. Lets explore the top 10 ways trading theory gets wrecked by real-world execution, complete with painful honesty and maybe a laugh or two because crying is for after market close. ________________________________________ 1. In theory You always follow your trading plan. In practice You make a new plan after every trade. That loss wasnt part of the plan, so obviously the plan was wrong. Lets fix it during the trade in real-time while it bleeds. Genius. ________________________________________ 2. In theory You manage risk carefully. In practice Let me just move the stop... just this once... just 10 more pips... Before you know it, your stop loss is in the next timezone, and your trade is now a long-term investment. ________________________________________ 3. In theory Backtesting proves the strategy works. I n practice Backtest you, alone, with no emotions, clicking replay in TradingView. Live trading markets screaming, Twitter panicking, and you entering on the 1-minute chart because it felt right. ________________________________________ 4. In theory Youll be objective. In practice You saw one green candle and whispered This is it. The reversal. I feel it. You werent objective. You were in a situationship with your trade. ________________________________________ 5. In theory RR 21 minimum. In practice You close at 0.3R just to be safe and then it hits target 10 minutes later while you re-enter worse, and get stopped. ________________________________________ 6. In theory You wait for confirmation. In practice You anticipate confirmation. You hope for confirmation. Spoiler hope is not a strategy. But hey, at least you learned again. ________________________________________ 7. In theory Youre a rules-based, emotionless trader. In practice You meditate, breathe deeply, journal, and then buy Gold after CPI with no stop loss and max leverage. So much for being the Terminator. ________________________________________ 8. In theory More knowledge better performance. I n practice You read five books, memorized all candlestick names, and still entered long into resistance because it looked bullish. Trading isnt trivia night. Its controlled decision-making under fire. ________________________________________ 9. In theory Youll accept losses calmly. In practice First you rage-quit. Then you revenge trade. Then you open ChatGPT and ask Should I hedge this 80 drawdown? ________________________________________ 10. In theory Youll be consistent. In practice You traded London Open on Monday, Asian Session on Tuesday, and New York close on Friday. Consistency? You dont even use the same time frame twice in a row. ________________________________________ So how do you bridge the gap? 1. Journal your trades honestly. Especially the emotional mess-ups. 2. Create rules you can actually follow not Instagram-quote rules. 3. Simulate real conditions including drawdowns, boredom, and fakeouts. 4. Accept that mistakes are part of the job and build for resilience, not perfection. 5. Trade small enough that you dont care much so you can learn while surviving. ________________________________________ Final word Trading theory is like a clean whiteboard. But the market? Its a chaotic toddler with crayons and no rules. If you can operate inside that chaos with clarity and emotional control thats when the theory starts working.

Education by abhirampajj 0 THE CONCEPT OF SUPPORT BECOMING RESISTANCE In the context of forex trading, the concept of support becoming resistance refers to a phenomenon that occurs when a price level that previously acted as a support level for an assets price now switches roles and becomes a resistance level after it has been broken. Heres a more detailed explanation Support Level In forex trading, a support level is a price level at which a currency pair or any other financial instrument tends to find buying interest. This buying interest is strong enough to halt or reverse a downtrend in the price. Traders believe that the assets price is likely to bounce off this support level and move higher, making it an essential point on the price chart. Resistance Level On the other hand, a resistance level is a price level where selling interest is significant enough to prevent the price from rising further. It acts as a barrier that tends to halt or reverse an uptrend in the price. Traders expect the price to bounce off this resistance level and move lower. Support Becoming Resistance The interesting concept comes into play when the price breaks below a previously established support level. When a support level is breached and the price continues to decline, it signifies a shift in market sentiment. The level that was once a support now becomes a resistance level for the price. If the price attempts to rally back up and reach that previous support level, it often faces selling pressure from traders who missed the initial breakdown and now see it as an opportunity to sell at a better price. As a result, the price might struggle to move beyond that level, and it starts acting as a resistance zone.

Real Examples Your Forex broker could be manipulating your trades right now - and you would not even know it. They can rig your charts, trap you in losing trades and steal your money. In this article, I will expose how they do it, I will show you a real example how brokers manipulations can lead to bad trading decisions and significant losses. What Im about to show you will change the way you trade forever, and youll never look at your trading charts the same way again. The story started with a trading live stream in my academy with my students. We spotted a nice setup to trade. We found a strong 4H support on Silver with a confirmed liquidity grab after its test. As a confirmation, we identified a cup handle pattern on an hourly time frame and a breakout of its neckline with a bullish imbalance. When I got my entry signal, I opened my trading terminal to execute the trade. And the way I trade is very specific I use TradingView for chart analysis BUT I have a separate trading terminal for trade execution. When I opened the same setup in my trading terminal, I saw a completely different picture and a strong bearish signal. The broker that I use for technical chart analysis is OANDA , while my trading terminal uses ICMarkets quotes. On the right is the price chart of SILVER with IC. There we can see a valid breakout and a candle close below the support with its consequent retest. From a price action perspective, it is a strong signal to sell . I got a strong feeling that some kind of manipulation is going on here, so I decided to check Silver charts of other brokers. Only the broker that I used for market analysis on TradingView provided a bullish signal, while other brokers had very bearish charts on Silver. It looked very suspicious and felt like OANDA broker was inducing me to buy, knowing that the price is going to drop. So I made a decision not to take a trade. Look what happened then. After a retest of a broken support, Silver dropped sharply. Checking the same trading setup on different brokers charts can help you to avoid the manipulation. My simple decision to examine more charts helped to avoid a losing trade. I strictly recommend you doing the same thing before you place a trade. IF you see a strong deviation of your charts from other brokers, stay alert and vigilant. Probably it is not a good idea to open the trade. Please, support my work with like, thank you!

Support at 3256.73? Resistance at 3352.14? Really? That precise? This kind of fixed-point trading might look good on a chart, but it doesnt work in a real, volatile market especially not in 2025. Ive been trading Gold as my primary asset for over a decade, and if theres one thing experience and logic have consistently shown me, its this you should trade price zones, not fixed points. Let me explain you why. ________________________________________ 1. Gold Is Not a Low-Volatility Asset Gold isnt EURUSD. It doesnt move in clean 20-30-pip increments. Its volatile, reactive, and sensitive to everything from Fed rate rumors to random tweets and global conflicts. Over the past months, volatility has spiked and not just because of economic data. Were seeing Geopolitical uncertainty that escalates and de-escalates overnight Macro shifts in interest rate expectations almost weekly Market sentiment changing faster than ever In this environment, the idea that price will reverse exactly at 3352.14 is pure fantasy. ________________________________________ 2. Percentages Matter More Than Pips Now Back when Gold was around 2000, a 200-pip move meant a 1 change in price. Now, with Gold trading above 3300, the same 1 move is 330 pips. So, if youre still treating 3050 pips like a serious target on Gold, youre not adjusting to reality. Youre chasing crumbs in a storm. Ive written before about why you shouldnt trade Gold for small 3050 pip moves. Its no longer a high-probability game the math doesnt work. Youre either over-leveraging or underperforming. ________________________________________ 3. Price Zones Are Where the Smart Money Trades Markets arent binary. They dont care about your exact number. They care about liquidity zones where enough buyers and sellers are willing to transact in volume. Heres how professionals approach it Support isnt a number its a range. Resistance isnt a line its a battle zone. When you analyze Gold, think in ranges like 32803290 or 33203330. This is where price breathes, traps traders, and makes real moves. Fixed points create unrealistic expectations and false confidence. ________________________________________ 4. Emotion Kills Precision in Real Time In live trading, youre not a machine. Youre a human reacting to candles, tweets, and news. Waiting for an entry at exactly 3352.14 often means You miss the move entirely Or you force a bad entry when price front-runs your level But when you use zones, you give yourself the flexibility to act within context, not dogma. You can read the candle behavior inside that zone, you can spot exhaustion, you can scale in or out you become tactical, not rigid. ________________________________________ Final Thoughts Adapt or Stay Frustrated If you want to trade Gold successfully in this current market, you must adapt Use zones instead of pin-point levels Adjust your expectations to the new pip-to-percentage dynamics Respect the volatility and macro backdrop The traders who will survive are not the ones with the cleanest lines on their charts. Theyre the ones who know how to handle chaos with structure, using zones as flexible tools, not false certainties. Start thinking in ranges, not numbers. Thats where the edge is.

Traders rely on various tools and techniques to trade the forex market. Naked forex trading is one of the oldest and most popular trading approaches among currency traders. This article delves into the details of naked trading, providing insights into its implementation and distinguishing features that set it apart from other analysis techniques. Understanding Naked Forex Trading Naked trading is a trading style that involves analysing markets using a clean price chart, meaning one without technical indicators. Traders who use this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts. Naked trading has its roots in the early days of trading, long before the advent of sophisticated technical analysis tools and indicators. Early traders relied solely on price action and market behaviour to make trading decisions. By stripping away the complexity of modern trading tools, naked trading aims to return to the fundamental principles of trading, emphasising the importance of understanding market psychology and price dynamics. Core Principles of Naked Forex Trading Naked forex trading is based on the following principles - Price action analysis is the foundation of naked trading, focusing on the examination of asset price movements without the help of technical indicators. Traders rely on bar, line, or Japanese candlestick charts to identify patterns, trends, and key support and resistance levels. By concentrating on real-time price movements, traders aim to make their trading decisions based on how prices behave at specific levels. - Naked trading emphasises simplicity and clarity as it removes the clutter of numerous trading tools. This approach helps traders maintain a clear view of the market, making it potentially easier to identify trading opportunities. The simplification also reduces cognitive load, enabling traders to focus on the most critical market movements. - Trader instinct, often referred to as gut feeling or traders intuition, plays a significant role in naked trading. This instinct is honed over time through experience and the extensive observation of price movements and market behaviour. Key Techniques and Tools Mastering price action analysis is crucial in naked trading. These are the four key tools for those who use naked trading. Candlestick Patterns Candlestick patterns play a crucial role in naked trading strategy by providing visual representations of price movements over a specified period. Traders look for different price formations to analyse potential market reversals, continuations, or indecisions. Common candlestick patterns include doji, engulfing patterns, hammer, shooting star, and spinning top. Each offers insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements. Chart Patterns Chart patterns on price charts indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Traders using naked trading techniques rely on chart patterns like flags, rounding topbottom, diamonds, and rectangles to identify key levels where the price is likely to react. These patterns help traders anticipate market movements and plan entry and exit points accordingly. Support and Resistance Levels Support and resistance levels are fundamental concepts in naked trading, representing levels the price struggled to break above resistance or hold above support. Traders identify these levels on price charts to anticipate potential price reversals or breakouts. Support and resistance levels are crucial for setting profit targets, placing stop-loss orders, and managing risk. Trendlines and Channels Trendlines and channels are used by naked traders to visualise the direction and strength of a trend. Trendlines connect successive higher lows uptrend or lower highs downtrend on a price chart, helping traders identify trend reversals or confirm trend continuations. Channels are formed by drawing parallel lines to connect highs and lows, creating a channel in which the price typically moves. Advantages of Naked Forex Trading Naked trading has many advantages therefore, its still used by traders around the globe. Here are the key benefits of naked forex trading - Enhanced Focus and Simplicity This approach removes market clutter as it offers enhanced focus by eliminating complex technical indicators. Without the distraction of multiple indicators that provide lagging signals, traders may respond more effectively to changes in price movements. - Improved Market Understanding By relying on naked trading tools, traders may better understand market behaviour and psychology. Observing price action directly on charts potentially enhances traders ability to interpret market sentiment, identify key support and resistance levels, and anticipate potential trend reversals or continuations. This hands-on approach fosters a deeper understanding of the nuances of the market and improves trading skills over time. - Flexibility and Adaptability Traders are not constrained by specific indicator signals or rigid trading rules. Instead, they can adjust their approach based on real-time price action and evolving market dynamics. This flexibility allows them to take advantage of emerging opportunities and adapt their strategies to potentially mitigate risks. Challenges and Limitations Although naked trading can be effective, it has limitations that a trader considers before relying on this approach. - Learning Curve As naked forex trading relies heavily on interpreting price action without the assistance of technical indicators, traders may need to dedicate considerable time and effort to mastering candlestick patterns, chart analysis, and understanding market psychology. Developing the skill to interpret price movements accurately demands persistence and consistent practice. - Emotional Discipline A notable challenge of naked trading is the absence of clear buy or sell signals provided by indicators, which can lead to heightened emotional responses to market fluctuations. Traders must maintain discipline by adhering to their trading plans, implementing risk management strategies, and avoiding impulsive decisions. - Market Noise Navigating market noise is another hurdle in naked trading. Market noise refers to random price fluctuations that obscure meaningful price patterns. Traders need the patience and experience to distinguish between significant price movements and temporary fluctuations. Practical Application of Naked Forex Trading Setting up a trading plan is essential for implementing naked forex trading. Traders might use the following rules - Define Your Trading Goals Determine your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and period of trading. - Select Currency Pairs Choose currency pairs that align with your trading strategy and offer sufficient liquidity. - Identify Key Trading Times Determine optimal times to trade based on market volatility and your availability. - Establish Entry and Exit Rules Define criteria for entering trades based on price action signals, such as candlestick patterns or supportresistance levels. Similarly, rules for exiting trades should be established to potentially lock in returns or cut losses. - Risk Management Implement risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and calculating position sizes based on your risk tolerance and account size. - Review and Adapt Regularly review your plan to assess its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments based on evolving market conditions and personal trading performance. Real-Life Examples and Case Studies Real-life examples and case studies illustrate how naked forex trading principles are applied in practice Example 1 Trading Support and Resistance A trader identifies a currency pair approaching a key support level on the daily chart. They wait for a bullish reversal candlestick pattern, such as dragonfly doji, to form near the support level. They enter a long trade with a stop-loss below the support level and a profit target at the next resistance level. Example 2 Trend Confirmation A trader observes a currency pair in a strong downtrend on the hourly chart. They wait for a pullback to a trendline and look for a bearish engulfing pattern to confirm the continuation of the downtrend. They enter a sell trade with a tight stop-loss above the trendline. However, it is difficult to determine the profit target as there are no swing lows nearby. The Bottom Line When they understand the naked trading forex strategy, traders may use it in other markets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, its important to note that any analysis does not guarantee effective trading, and other factors should be considered alongside chart analysis. Risk management and a proper mindset are essential for long-term consistency. FAQs What Is Naked Trading in Forex? Naked, or price action trading, is a forex trading approach that involves analysing the market using a clean price chart without any technical indicators. Traders relying on this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts rather than past performance. The strategy emphasises identifying key support and resistance levels, trend reversals, and price corrections purely through the observation of bar, line, or candlestick charts. Can I Trade Without Chart Patterns? Yes, trading without chart patterns may be possible using alternative methods such as indicator-based strategies, quantitative models, fundamental analysis, or sentiment analysis. These approaches allow traders to analyse the markets based on technical indicators, mathematical algorithms, economic data, or market sentiment. What Is a Chart Pattern in a Price Action Strategy? A chart pattern in a price action strategy refers to the specific formations and shapes created by the price movements of an asset, which traders use to analyse future market behaviour. These patterns emerge due to the collective actions of buyers and sellers and can indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Some common chart patterns include triangles suggesting a consolidation before a breakout, Quasimodo indicating a potential trend reversal, and flags signalling the continuation of an existing trend. What Is the 5-3-1 Trading Strategy? The 5-3-1 trading strategy is a disciplined approach designed to help traders focus and improve their trading skills. It involves trading just five currency pairs to reduce complexity and enhance expertise in those markets. Traders then use only three specific strategies to master and consistently apply. Finally, they select one trading timeframe to maintain consistency and avoid confusion. Important At FXOpen UK, Cryptocurrency trading via CFDs is only available to our Professional clients.

Support and resistance levels show where price has reacted strongly in the past. These are zones where many traders including large players have placed buy or sell orders. Support where buyers step in and push price up Resistance where sellers step in and push price down These levels are important because they act like decision zones - Price might bounce from these levels - Or break through and start a new move - Or even fake out traders before reversing again Knowing where these levels are gives you an edge - You can better time your entries and exits - You avoid chasing price in the middle of nowhere - You prepare for market reactions not random guesses Think of them like traffic lights for the market when price hits them, something important usually happens. 2 Three Main Types of Support and Resistance There are 3 key types of support and resistance levels traders commonly use - Level-Based Horizontal zones drawn from key highs and lows - Pattern-Based Supportresistance found in chart patterns like triangles, flags, etc. - Channel-Based Diagonal trendlines showing support and resistance in a channel Today, we focus on level-based support and resistance horizontal lines drawn on key price zones. 3 How to Draw Support and Resistance Levels Use daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes to find major zones. These higher timeframes give you stronger, more respected levels. Look for - Candle bodies that close and open around the same price - Strong wicks rejecting a certain level - Zones where price has bounced multiple times in the past I often pick - The close of a red candle - The open of the next green candle These spots usually show where sellers lost control and buyers stepped in or vice versa. 4 Timeframes and Their Strength The higher the timeframe, the stronger the level - Monthly very strong, long-term zones - Weekly strong and reliable - Daily useful for swing trading - Lower timeframes 15m, 5m more noise, less reliable unless youre day trading or scalping Pick levels based on your strategy - Swing traders use dailyweeklymonthly - Scalpers lower timeframes with extra confluence volume, structure 5 Dont Use SupportResistance Alone Support and resistance are helpful but not enough by themselves. Always combine them with - Market structure higher highslows - Volume confirmation - Indicators or price action signals You want to watch how price reacts at your levels. Wait for confirmation before making decisions. 6 Common Mistakes Traders Make Mistake 1 Drawing too many levels clutters your chart and creates confusion. Mistake 2 Keeping old levels that have already been broken or invalidated. Mistake 3 Ignoring volume. Just because price hits a level doesnt mean it will reverse. You need volume to back the move. Also Dont enter blindly on breakout, breakouts can fail. Wait for confirmation. Dont assume a level is strong just because its touched once look for multiple rejections. 7 Example How I Draw SupportResistance Lets say Im looking at a daily chart. - I find a red candle that closes at 42,000 - Then a green candle opens at 42,000 and pushes higher That tells me buyers stepped in at 42,000 this is a potential support. I draw my horizontal line across that level. Then I zoom into 30m or 15m charts to watch price behavior when it comes back to that level. If price respects it again, I may enter a trade based on the reaction. This technique gives me more confidence and clarity. I know where liquidity might be waiting. I can combine it with indicators or volume tools. I avoid random trades. Summary Identify a timeframe Use the monthly, weekly, or daily chart. Look for two candles Draw your support or resistance line at the point where one candle closes and the next one opens. Make sure the level hasnt been hit yet This helps you spot areas where liquidity grabs might happen. Wait for price to reach the level Once price touches the support or resistance zone, watch how it reacts. After price touches the level, remove it Once tested, that level is no longer fresh and should be cleared from your chart. Support and resistance isnt magic but used with confluence, it becomes a powerful guide. Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE and COMMENT if you enjoy this idea!

Education by Risk_Adj_Return 0 Mastering the ICT Power of 3 concept - How to use it in trading! The financial markets often appear chaotic and unpredictable, but behind the scenes, institutional players operate with clear strategies that shape price action. One such strategy is the ICT Inner Circle Trader Power of 3 model, a framework used to understand and anticipate market cycles through three key phases accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. This guide will break down each of these phases in detail, explaining how smart money operates and how retail traders can align themselves with the true direction of the market. What will be discussed? - The 3 phases - Examples of the PO3 - How to trade the PO3 - Tips for trading the PO3 The 3 phases Accumulation The Accumulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model refers to the initial stage of a market cycle where institutional or smart money participants quietly build their positions. During this time, price typically moves sideways within a tight range, often showing little to no clear direction. This is intentional. The market appears quiet or indecisive, which is designed to confuse retail traders and keep them out of alignment with the real intentions of the markets larger players. In this phase, smart money is not looking to move the market dramatically. Instead, they are focused on accumulating long or short positions without drawing attention. They do this by keeping price contained within a consolidation zone. The idea is to gather enough liquidity, often from unsuspecting retail traders entering early breakout trades or trying to trade the range, before making a more aggressive move. Manipulation The Manipulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the second stage that follows accumulation. This phase is where smart money deliberately moves the market in the opposite direction of their intended move to trigger retail stop losses, induce emotional decisions, and create liquidity. After price has consolidated during accumulation, many retail traders are either already positioned or have orders waiting just outside the range, either stop losses from those trading the range or breakout orders from those anticipating a directional move. The manipulation phase exploits this positioning. Price will often break out of the accumulation range in one direction, appearing to confirm a new trend. This move is designed to look convincing, it might even come with a spike in volume or momentum to draw traders in. However, this breakout is a false move. It doesnt represent the true intention of smart money. Instead, its meant to sweep liquidity, triggering stop losses above or below the range, and then reverse sharply. This stop run provides the liquidity needed for large players to finalize their positions at optimal prices. Once enough liquidity is collected, and retail traders are caught offside, the real move begins. Distribution The Distribution Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the final stage of the cycle, following accumulation and manipulation. This is where the true intention of smart money is revealed, and the market makes a sustained, directional move, either bullish or bearish. Unlike the earlier phases, distribution is marked by clear price expansion, increased volatility, and decisive momentum. After smart money has accumulated positions and shaken out retail traders through manipulation, they have the liquidity and positioning needed to drive the market in their desired direction. The distribution phase is where these positions are distributed into the broader market, meaning, institutions begin to offload their positions into the retail flow that is now chasing the move. Retail traders, seeing the strong trend, often jump in late, providing the liquidity for smart money to exit profitably. This phase is typically what retail traders perceive as the real trend, and in a sense, it is. However, by the time the trend is obvious, smart money has already entered during accumulation and profited from the manipulation. What appears to be a breakout or trend continuation to most retail participants is actually the final leg of the smart moneys strategy. They are now unloading their positions while price continues to expand. Examples of the Power of 3 How to trade the PO3? Start by identifying a clear accumulation range. This typically happens during the Asian session or the early part of the London session. Price moves sideways, forming a consolidation zone. Your job here isnt to trade, but to observe. Draw horizontal lines marking the high and low of the range. These become your key liquidity zones. Next, anticipate the manipulation phase, which usually occurs during the London session or at the NY open. Price will often break out of the range, triggering stop losses above the high or below the low of the accumulation zone. This move is deceptive, it is not the real trend. Do not chase it. Instead, wait for signs of rejection, such as a sharp reversal after the liquidity grab, imbalance filling, or a shift in market structure on a lower timeframe like a 1- or 5-minute chart. Once manipulation has swept liquidity and price starts showing signs of reversing back inside the range or beyond, you now look for a confirmation of the true move, this begins the distribution phase. You enter in the direction opposite of the manipulation move, ideally once price breaks a structure level confirming that smart money has taken control. For example, if price consolidates overnight, fakes a move to the downside running sell stops, and then quickly reverses and breaks above a key swing high, thats your signal that the true move is likely up. Enter after the break and retest of structure, using a tight stop loss below the recent low. Your target should be based on liquidity pools, fair value gaps, or higher-timeframe imbalances. The key to trading the Power of 3 is patience and precision. Youre not trying to catch every move, but to wait for the market to complete its cycle of deception and then ride the clean expansion. Ideally, your entry comes just after manipulation, and you hold through the distributionexpansion phase, taking partials at key liquidity levels along the way. Tips for trading the PO3 1. Learn price movements Before you can effectively apply the ICT Power of 3 strategy, its crucial to have a deep understanding of how price behaves. This means being comfortable identifying market structure, recognizing trend direction, and interpreting candlestick dynamics. Since the Power of 3 is deeply rooted in how price moves in real time, a strong grasp of these basics will give you the confidence to read the market correctly as each phase develops. 2. Analyse multiple timeframes Although the Power of 3 pattern shows up on lower timeframes, relying on just one can lead to misreads. Youll gain a clearer picture when you align the short-term view with higher timeframe structure. For example, what appears to be accumulation on the 15-minute chart may simply be a retracement in a larger trend on the 1-hour or daily. By examining multiple timeframes together, you can better identify the true setup and avoid being tricked by noise. 3. Exercise patience A key part of trading the Power of 3 is knowing when to act, and more importantly, when not to. Its easy to get impatient during the accumulation or manipulation phases, but entering too early often leads to frustration or losses. True discipline comes from waiting for the expansion or distribution phase, when the market reveals its real direction. This is where the most favorable risk-to-reward setups occur.
