  "text": "Definition Portfolio management is the art of selecting and overseeing a group of investments that meet the long-term financial objectives and risk tolerance of a client, a company, or an institution. Portfolio management is the process of balancing risk against performance , determining the right mix of assets to optimize returns for the amount of risk youre willing to accept. While many people manage their own investment portfolios, many rely on professional portfolio managers. Regardless of approach, successfully managing a portfolio requires an in-depth understanding of the key building blocks that drive investment success, including thoughtful asset allocation, proper diversification , and disciplined rebalancing practices. Key Takeaways Portfolio management involves building and overseeing a selection of assets such as stocks, bonds, and cash that meet an investors long-term financial goals and risk tolerance. Active portfolio management requires strategically buying and selling stocks and other assets to beat the broader markets performance. Passive portfolio management seeks to match the markets returns by mimicking the makeup of an index or indexes. Investors can carry out strategies to aggressively pursue profits, conservatively attempt to preserve capital or a blend of both. Portfolio management requires having clear long-term goals, understanding any tax-code changes from the Internal Revenue Service IRS, knowledge of the investors risk tolerance, and a willingness to examine investment options. Understanding Portfolio Management Professional licensed portfolio managers work on behalf of clients, while individuals can build and manage their portfolios. In either case, the portfolio managers ultimate goal is to maximize the investments expected return within an appropriate level of risk exposure. Portfolio management requires the ability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a spectrum of investments. These choices involve trade-offs, from debt versus equity to domestic versus international and growth versus safety. Key Terms in Portfolio Management, With Examples Term Definition Examples Active Management A strategy where portfolio managers actively buy and sell securities in an attempt to outperform a benchmark. A fund manager might overweight technology stocks believing the sector will outperform the market. Alpha The excess return of an investment relative to its benchmark. An alpha of 1 means the investment outperformed its benchmark by 1. Asset Allocation The distribution of assets e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate within a portfolio to achieve a preferred risk-return profile. Conservative investors often have a higher allocation of bonds, while aggressive investors want more exposure to growth stocks. Asset Class A group of investments with similar characteristics e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate. A diversified portfolio might include multiple asset classes. Benchmark A standard against which the performance of an investment or portfolio is measured. A common benchmark for U.S. stocks is the SP 500 index. Beta A measure of an investments volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1 means the investment moves in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility. Diversification Spreading investments across assets to lower risk. Owning stocks from different industries or countries. Index Fund A type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund ETF that tracks the performance of a specific market index The SP 500 index , which tracks the largest 500 American publicly traded companies in terms of market capitalization. Liquidity The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. Stocks and ETFs are considered more liquid than real estate. Net Asset Value NAV The value per share of a mutual fund or ETF on a specific date or time. The NAV of a mutual fund fluctuates daily based on the market value of its underlying holdings. Passive Management A strategy that aims to replicate the performance of a benchmark index, often through investing in index funds or ETFs. An investor might choose a passive SP 500 index fund to mirror the performance of the U.S. large-cap market. Portfolio Optimization The process of selecting the best portfolio asset allocation given the investors constraints and objectives. Modern portfolio theory is a common approach to portfolio optimization. Rebalancing Adjusting a portfolios asset allocation back to its target percentages to maintain the desired risk-return profile. Selling some stocks and buying more bonds to return to a target allocation of 60 stocks and 40 bonds. Risk Tolerance An investors ability and willingness to withstand changes in the value of their holdings. An investor with a high-risk tolerance might be comfortable with a portfolio of mostly stocks. Risk-Return Tradeoff The principle that potential returns rise with an increase in risk. Thus, lower-risk investments offer lower potential returns, while higher-risk investments offer higher potential returns. Stocks are generally considered riskier than bonds, but they also have the potential for higher returns. Sharpe Ratio A measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated as the excess return of an investment over the risk-free rate divided by its standard deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Tracking Error The difference between the performance of a portfolio and the performance of its benchmark index. A tracking error of 1 means the portfolios return deviated from the benchmarks return by 1. Turnover The percentage of a portfolios holdings that are sold and replaced over a specific period. A high turnover rate can result in higher transaction costs and have tax implications. Volatility The degree of variation in prices over time for a given asset. Stocks with high volatility experience larger price swings than those with low volatility. Who Uses Portfolio Management Portfolio management is a critical investment practice used by two types of entities individual and institutional investors . These categories have distinct strategies, goals, and resources. Understanding the different approaches and needs of these two types of investors can provide greater insight into how portfolio management techniques are applied across the financial spectrum. Individual investors often focus on personal wealth and future needs , managing smaller amounts of money with varying degrees of professional assistance. In contrast, institutional investors manage large-scale assets with a professional approach tailored to fulfill specific financial obligations and institutional goals. Both groups, however, aim to improve their returns by managing their portfolios to suit specific circumstances and financial objectives. Individual Investors Individual investors have a range of personal goals, risk preferences, and resources. Their objectives include saving for retirement, accumulating wealth for large purchases, funding education for children, or building an emergency fund. Each goal requires a different strategy or risk profile. Individual investors risk tolerance and investment knowledge vary greatly. Their approach to managing investments can range from highly engaged active trading and rebalancing to relying on automated or professional management. As financial markets have evolved and technology has widened access to investment information, individual investors have had wider prospects to tailor their investment strategies to meet their financial objectives. Institutional Investors Institutional investors are entities that pool large sums of money and invest those funds into various financial instruments and assets pension funds, endowments, foundations, banks, and insurance companies. Each has specific objectives and constraints that influence its portfolio management strategies. Many institutional investors have long-term financial obligations that cause them to focus on long-term growth and sustainability over short-term gains. In addition, institutional investors are often under strict regulatory oversight to ensure they manage their beneficiaries funds responsibly. Moreover, ethical and social governance issues increasingly influence their investment decisions. Risk management is a crucial part of the work of an institutional portfolio manager since these entities must balance the need for profitability with the imperative of preserving capital to meet future liabilities. Institutional investors investment approaches are typically conservative compared with individual investors, focusing on long-term stability, capital preservation, and meeting future obligations. Indeed, each type of institutional investor has distinct strategies and objectives, but all share the common goal of responsibly managing large pools of capital to meet the needs of their stakeholders. Passive vs. Active Management Portfolio management can be either passive or active. Active vs. Passive Portfolio Management Active Management Approach Hands-on Cost Implications More costly Performance Historically, over long periods, underperforms Passive Management Approach Hands-off Cost Implications Less costly Performance Historically, over long periods, performs like the market Passive management is the set-it-and-forget-it long-term strategy. It may involve investing in one or more ETFs. This is commonly referred to as indexing or index investing . Those who build indexed portfolios may use modern portfolio theory to help them optimize the mix. Active management involves attempting to beat an indexs performance by actively buying and selling individual stocks and other assets. Closed-end funds and many mutual funds are generally actively managed. Active managers may use any of a wide range of quantitative or qualitative models to aid in their evaluation of potential investments. Active Portfolio Management Investors who use an active management approach have fund managers or brokers to buy and sell stocks in an attempt to outperform a specific index, such as the Standard Poors 500 Index or the Russell 1000 Index. Often, these investors will also use portfolio management software to help them track their investments. An actively managed investment fund has an individual portfolio manager, co-managers, or a team of managers actively making investment decisions for the fund. The success of an actively managed fund depends on a combination of in-depth research, market forecasting, and the expertise of the portfolio manager or management team. Portfolio managers engaged in active investing pay close attention to market trends , shifts in the economy, changes to the political landscape, and news that affects companies. This data is used to time the purchase or sale of investments to take advantage of market irregularities. Active managers claim that these processes will boost the potential for returns higher than those achieved by simply tracking the holdings on a particular index. Trying to beat the market inevitably involves market risk. Indexing eliminates this particular risk, as there is less probability of human error in selecting the index stocks. Index funds are also traded less often, which means that they incur lower expense ratios and are more tax-efficient than actively managed funds. Passive Portfolio Management Passive portfolio management, also known as index fund management, aims to duplicate the return of a particular market index or benchmark. Managers buy the same stocks listed on the index, using the same weighting that they represent in the index. A passive strategy portfolio can be structured as an ETF, a mutual fund, or a unit investment trust. Index funds are branded as passively managed because each has a portfolio manager whose job is to replicate the index rather than select the assets bought or sold. Management fees assessed on passive portfolios or funds are typically far lower than those of active management strategies. Discretionary vs. Non-Discretionary Management Another critical element of portfolio management is the concept of discretionary and non-discretionary management . This approach dictates what a third party may be allowed to do regarding your portfolio. A discretionary or non-discretionary management style is only relevant if you have an independent broker managing your portfolio. If you want the broker to execute trades that you have explicitly approved, you must opt for a non-discretionary investment account. The broker may advise you on strategy and suggest investment moves. However, without your approval, the broker is simply an advisor who must follow your instructions. Meanwhile, some investors would prefer to leave all decisions to their broker or financial manager. In these situations, the financial advisor can buy or sell securities without the investors approval. However, the advisor still has a fiduciary responsibility to act in the clients best interest when managing their portfolio. Key Elements of Portfolio Management Asset Allocation The key to effective portfolio management is the long-term mix of assets . Generally, that means stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents such as certificates of deposit. There are others, called alternative investments, such as real estate, commodities, derivatives, and cryptocurrency. Asset allocation is based on the understanding that different types of assets do not move in concert, and some are more volatile than others. A mix of assets provides balance and protects against risk. Investors with a more aggressive profile weigh their portfolios more toward volatile investments such as growth stocks. Investors with a conservative profile weigh their portfolios toward stabler investments such as bonds and blue chip stocks . Important Rebalancing captures recent gains and opens new prospects while keeping the portfolio in line with its original risk-return profile. Diversification The only certainty in investing is that it is impossible to consistently predict winners and losers. The prudent approach is to create a basket of investments that provides broad exposure across different assets. Diversification involves spreading the risk and reward of individual securities within an asset class or between asset classes. Because it is difficult to know which subset of an asset class or sector is likely to outperform another, diversification seeks to capture the returns of different sectors over time while reducing volatility. Real diversification is made across various classes of securities, sectors of the economy, and geographical regions. Rebalancing Rebalancing returns a portfolio to its original target allocation at regular intervals, usually annually. It reinstates the original asset mix when market movements push it out of kilter. For example, a portfolio that starts with a 70 equity and 30 fixed-income allocation could, after an extended market rally, shift to an 8020 allocation. Investors have made a good profit, but the portfolio now has more risk than investors with that balance can tolerate. Rebalancing generally involves selling high-priced securities and investing the money in lower-priced and out-of-favor securities. This annual exercise allows investors to capture gains and expand their chances for growth in high-potential sectors while keeping the portfolio aligned with the original risk-return profile. Tax-Efficiency A potentially material aspect of portfolio management relates to how your portfolio is shaped to minimize taxes over the long term. This is relevant for retirement accounts, as well as how long you plan to hold certain assets and which ones you choose. For example, certain bonds may be tax-exempt. This means that any interest earned is not subject to taxes. Meanwhile, the IRS has different tax rules for short-term and long-term capital gains. For single filers and married couples filing separately earning less than 48,350 in 2025, their capital gains rate may be 0. Meanwhile, a long-term capital gains tax of 15 applies if your income is above this threshold but below 533,400 for single filers. For incomes above 533,400 single filers or 600,050 married filing jointly, the rate increases to 20. Fast Fact Portfolios include investments across cash accounts, 401ks, IRAs, and other retirement accounts. Common Portfolio Management Strategies Every investors specific situation is unique. Therefore, while some investors may be risk-averse, others may be inclined to pursue the greatest returns while also incurring the greatest risk. Very broadly speaking, here are several common portfolio management strategies an investor can consider Aggressive An aggressive portfolio prioritizes maximizing its potential earnings. Often invested in riskier industries or unproven alternative assets, investors may be willing to risk losses. Instead, investors are looking for a home run investment by striking it big with a single investment. Conservative Meanwhile, a conservative portfolio relates to capital preservation. Extremely risk-averse investors may adopt a portfolio management strategy that minimizes growth and the risk of losses. Moderate A moderate portfolio management strategy blends an aggressive and conservative approach. To get the best of both worlds, a moderate portfolio still invests heavily in equities but also diversifies and may be more selective about which equities it invests in. Income-oriented This is often the option of choice for retired investors, who wish to live off their portfolio returns. These returns could come from bond coupons or dividends. Tax efficiency As discussed above, investors may be inclined to focus primarily on minimizing taxes, even at the expense of higher returns. This may be especially important for high earners in the highest income tax bracket. It may also be a priority for young investors who have a very long way to go until retirement. By getting started with a Roth IRA , these investors can grow their portfolio over time and face no federal taxes on these funds when they retire. The Retirement Security Rule When building and managing investment portfolios, its crucial to understand the regulatory environment that governs financial advice. One significant aspect of this landscape is the Department of Labors April 2024 fiduciary rule, known as the Retirement Security Rule , which has been undergoing legal challenges since its introduction. The Retirement Security Rule was finalized in April 2024 and originally scheduled to take effect on Sept. 23, 2024. However, in July 2024, two Federal District Courts in Texas issued orders blocking implementation, ruling that industry trade groups would likely prevail in their argument that the DOL exceeded its authority. The Department of Justice filed an appeal to the Fifth Circuit, but following the change in presidential administrations in January 2025, the DOL filed a motion to pause the litigation, effectively putting the rules future in doubt. As such, the financial services industry remains subject to the previous five-part test from a 1975 DOL regulation. Under this standard, professionals are considered fiduciaries when providing investment advice if they meet all of the following criteria Renders advice The individual renders advice about the value of securities or other property, or makes recommendations on investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or other property. Regularity The advice is provided regularly. Mutual agreement There is a mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding with the plan or a plan fiduciary that the advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions. Individualized advice The advice is individualized based on the particular needs of the plan. Primary basis for decisions The advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions. This standard has been criticized for being too narrow, potentially allowing some financial professionals to avoid fiduciary responsibility even when providing important investment recommendations. These developments underscore the importance of individual investors understanding the nature of their relationship with financial advisors. Its crucial to know whether your advisor is acting as a fiduciary and what standards of care they are required to meet when providing investment advice, particularly for retirement accounts. Challenges of Portfolio Management Whatever strategy is chosen, portfolio management always faces several hurdles that often cant be eliminated entirely. Even if an investor has a foolproof portfolio management strategy, investment portfolios are subject to market fluctuations and volatility. The best management approach can still suffer from significant losses. Though diversification is an important aspect of portfolio management, it can also be challenging to achieve. Finding the right mix of asset classes and investments to balance risk and return requires an in-depth understanding of the market and the investors risk tolerance. Buying a wide range of securities may also be expensive to meet the desired diversification. To devise the best portfolio management strategy, an investor must first know their risk tolerance, investment horizon , and return expectations. This requires a clear short-term and long-term goal. Because life circumstances can quickly and rapidly change, investors must be mindful of how some strategies limit liquidity or flexibility. In addition, the IRS may change tax regulations, forcing you to change your investment strategy. Lastly, portfolio managers charge fees. The portfolio manager must often meet specific regulatory reporting requirements, and managers may not have the same views of the market as you do. How Do I Determine My Risk Tolerance? This is influenced by your financial goals, investment time horizon, income, and personal comfort with risk. Tools like risk tolerance questionnaires can help quantify your risk tolerance by asking about your reactions to hypothetical market scenarios and your investment preferences. In addition, thinking back to your past investment experiences and consulting with a financial advisor can provide a clearer understanding of the kinds of investments that are right for you in terms of your risk tolerance. What Is Asset Allocation? Asset allocation involves spreading the investors money among different asset classes so that risks are reduced and opportunities for profit are maximized. Stocks, bonds, and cash are the three most common asset classes, but others include real estate, commodities, currencies, and crypto. Within each of these are subclasses that play into a portfolio allocation . What Should I Do If My Portfolio Has Significant Losses? If this happens, its important to avoid panic selling and instead assess the situation calmly. Start by reviewing your investment strategy to ensure it still aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. Consider whether the losses are because of market volatility or fundamental changes in the assets you hold. Rebalancing your portfolio might be necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation. Diversifying your investments can also help mitigate future risks. Consulting with a financial advisor can give you guidance and help you make informed decisions about how to recover from your losses and adjust your strategy if needed. How Do I Evaluate How My Portfolio Is Doing? Evaluating the performance of your portfolio involves comparing its returns against benchmarks typically indexes that offer a mix like youre aiming for in your portfolio and considering your investment goals. Data to review include total return , your risk-adjusted return, and the performance of individual assets relative to their respective indexes. Its also important to review the consistency of your returns over time and whether your portfolio is making progress toward your objectives. The Bottom Line Anyone who wants to grow their money has choices to make. You can be your own investment portfolio manager, or you can hire a professional to do it for you. You can choose a passive management strategy by putting your money in index funds. You can also try to beat the markets by actively managing your portfolio. Youll want to pay attention to the basics of portfolio management pick a mix of assets to lower your overall risk, diversify your holdings to maximize your potential returns, and rebalance your portfolio regularly to keep the mix right.",
