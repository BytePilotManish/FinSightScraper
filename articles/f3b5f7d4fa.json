  "text": "Definition Dividends are periodic payments made to shareholders from corporate profits. What Are Dividends? Dividends are a percentage of a companys earnings paid to its shareholders as their share of the profits. Dividends are generally paid quarterly, with the amount decided by the board of directors based on the companys most recent earnings. Dividends may be paid in cash or additional shares. When a company announces a dividend, it also announces the payment date on which the dividend will be paid into the shareholders accounts. Key Takeaways A dividend is a distribution of a companys earnings to eligible shareholders. Dividend payments and amounts are determined by the companys board of directors. Many companies do not pay dividends and instead retain their earnings to be invested back into the company. Investopedia Julie Bang Understanding Dividends A dividend is a reward paid to the shareholders for their investment in a company, and it is usually paid out of the companys net profits. Some companies continue to make dividend payments even when their profits dont justify the expense. A steady track record of paying dividends makes stocks more attractive to investors. Various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ETFs also pay dividends. Dividends for stocks must be approved by shareholders for funds, the fund managers award dividends based on the funds net asset value and whether the fund receives dividends. Although cash dividends are common, dividends can also be issued as shares of stock. Fast Fact A stocks dividend yield is the dividend paid per share and is expressed as a percentage of the companys share price, such as 2.5. Who Gets Dividends and How Common stock shareholders of dividend-paying companies are eligible to receive a distribution as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date . This is essentially a cutoff date for assigning the dividend payment when shares change hands. Dividends are paid on a schedule set by the board. They may be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. For example, Walmart Inc. WMT and Unilever UL make regular quarterly dividend payments. Companies can also issue non-recurring special dividends, either individually or in addition to a scheduled dividend. For example, United Bancorp Inc. declared a 0.15 per share special dividend on Feb. 23, 2023. Fast Fact Not all companies pay dividends to the owners of common shares, but owners of preferred shares are guaranteed a set dividend payment. Dividend-Paying Companies Larger, established companies with predictable profits are often the best dividend payers. Companies within the following industry sectors maintain a regular record of dividend payments Basic materials Oil and gas Banks and financial Healthcare and pharmaceuticals Utilities Companies structured as master limited partnerships MLPs and real estate investment trusts REITS are required to make specified distributions to their shareholders. Funds may also issue regular dividend payments as stated in their investment objectives. Who Doesnt Pay a Dividend? Young, fast-growing companies such as those in the technology and biotechnology sectors may not pay regular dividends since they may be in the early stages of development and retain all of their earnings for research and development, business expansion, and operational activities. Investors tend to forgive the lack of a dividend if the companys stock price is growing rapidly. Not surprisingly, once a company begins paying dividends, it finds it difficult to reduce or suspend the payments. This is generally viewed by investors as a sign of falling profits, not to mention a loss of income. Important Dividend Dates Dividend payments follow a chronological order of events, and the associated dates are important in determining which shareholders qualify to receive the dividend payment Announcement date Dividends are announced by company management on the announcement date or declaration date and must be approved by the shareholders before they can be paid. Ex-dividend date The date on which the dividend eligibility expires is called the ex-dividend date or simply the ex-date. For instance, if a stock has an ex-date of Monday, May 5, shareholders who buy the stock on or after that day will NOT qualify to receive the dividend. Shareholders who own the stock one business day prior to the ex-date, on Friday, May 2, or earlier, qualify for the distribution. Record date The record date is the cutoff date, established by the company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution. Payment date The company issues the dividend payment on the payment date , which is when the money is credited to investors accounts. How Do Dividends Affect a Stocks Share Price? A stocks share price may change to reflect a dividend payment. For example, assume a company trading at 60 per share declares a 2 dividend. As the news becomes public, the share price may increase by 2 and hit 62. The stock might trade at 63 one business day before the ex-dividend date. On the ex-dividend date, its price will likely fall below its previous price, such as 61, at the start of the trading session, because anyone buying on the ex-dividend date will not receive the dividend. Why Do Companies Pay Dividends? Many investors buy stocks for their dividends rather than their share price growth potential. Some extraordinarily successful companies like Coca-Cola Co. are prized more by investors for their steady dividends than for their potential price growth. Dividends are often expected by shareholders as their share of the companys profits. Dividend payments reflect positively on a company and help maintain investors trust. A high-value dividend declaration can indicate that a company is doing well and has generated good profits. However, some may interpret it as an indication that the company does not have much going on in the way of new projects to generate better returns in the future. The company may appear to be using its cash to pay shareholders instead of reinvesting it into growth. A company with a long history of dividend payments that declares a reduction or elimination of its dividend signals trouble. However, a dividend cut does not necessarily translate into bad news. The companys management may have a plan for investing the money in a high-return project that could magnify returns for shareholders in the long run. Mutual Fund Dividends Dividends paid by funds are different from dividends paid by companies. Funds employ the principle of net asset value NAV, which reflects the valuation of their holdings or the price of the assets a fund has in its portfolio. Regular dividend payments should not be misread as a stellar performance by the fund. For example, a bond-investing fund may pay monthly dividends because it receives monthly interest on its interest-bearing holdings and merely transfers the income from the interest fully or partially to the funds investors. A stock-investing fund pays dividends from the earnings received from the many stocks held in its portfolio, or by selling a certain share of stocks and distributing capital gains. Are Dividends Irrelevant? Economists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani argued that a companys dividend policy is irrelevant and has no effect on its stock price or cost of capital . A shareholder may be indifferent to a companys dividend policy, especially if the dividend is used to buy more shares. If a dividend payout is seen as inadequate, an investor can sell shares to generate cash. In either case, the combination of the value of an investment in the company and the cash they hold will remain the same. Miller and Modigliani thus conclude that dividends are irrelevant, and investors shouldnt care about the firms dividend policy because they can create their own synthetically. This argument has done little to persuade the many investors who consider dividends an attractive investment incentive. How to Buy Dividend-Paying Investments Investors seeking dividend investments have several options, including stocks, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds ETFs. The dividend discount or Gordon growth models can help investors choose individual stocks. These techniques rely on anticipated future dividend streams to value shares. To compare multiple stocks based on their dividend payment performance, investors can use the dividend yield factor, which measures the dividend in terms of a percentage of the current market price of the companys share. How to Measure Dividends The dividend rate can be quoted in terms of the dollar amount each share receives as dividends per share DPS. In addition to dividend yield, another important performance measure to assess the returns generated from a particular investment is the total return factor. This figure accounts for interest, dividends, and increases in share price, among other capital gains. Tax is another important consideration when investing in dividend gains. Investors in high tax brackets often prefer dividend-paying stocks if their jurisdiction allows zero or comparatively lower tax on dividends. For example, Greece and Slovakia have a lower tax on dividend income for shareholders, while dividend gains are tax-exempt in Hong Kong. What Is a Dividend in Business? Dividends are business profits shared with and divided between investors. What Is an Example of a Dividend? A companys board of directors may decide to issue an annual 5 dividend per share. If the companys shares are worth 100, the dividend is 5. If the dividends are issued every quarter, each distribution is 1.25. Are Dividends Free Money? Dividends signal that a company has stable cash flow and is generating enough profits to provide investors with income. Because you need to purchase a stock or fund that pays dividends, and dividends are subject to taxes, they arent free. The Bottom Line Dividends are seen by many investors as a sign that a company is earning a healthy profit and, more to the point, is willing to share it with its investors. Not all companies pay dividends, and not all investors care about them. If you do, look for the best dividend-paying stocks for your money.",
