The U.S. unemployment rate is released on the first Friday of every month for the preceding month. The current and past editions of the report are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS . The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force without a job. It is a lagging indicator and generally rises or falls with changing economic conditions. Key Takeaways The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labor force that is not employed but could be. The BLS reported an unemployment rate for December 2024 of 4.1. U.S. unemployment data is released on the first Friday of every month. There are five other categories of unemployment, which measure labor underutilization. Investopedia Dennis Madamba Understanding the Unemployment Rate In the U.S., the most commonly cited national unemployment rate is the U-3, which the BLS releases as part of its monthly employment situation report. It defines unemployed people as those willing and available to work and who have actively sought work within the past four weeks. 4.1 The national unemployment rate for December 2024. The rate decreased by 0.1 from the previous month. According to the BLS, those with temporary, part-time, or full-time jobs are considered employed, as are those who perform at least 15 hours of unpaid work for a family business or farm. Many people who want to work but cannot or become discouraged after looking for work without success are not considered unemployed, but categorized outside the labor force. The unemployment rate is seasonally adjusted to account for predictable variations, such as extra hiring during the holidays. The BLS also provides the unadjusted rate. Unemployment Rate seasonally adjusted Unadjusted Unemployment by State Other Metrics The BLS publishes five alternative measures U-1, U-2, U-4, U-5, and U-6 . U-6 is often called the real unemployment rate, but U-3 is the only official unemployment rate. The others are measures of labor underutilization. U-1 The U-1 unemployment rate includes those unemployed for 15 weeks or more as a percent of the civilian labor force . The U-1 unemployment rate as of December 2024 was 1.6.

This category includes people who lack the necessary qualifications or education and believe work is unavailable in their field.

The U-5 rate for December 2024 was 5.0. The marginally attached include discouraged workers and anyone who would like a job and has looked for one in the past 12 months but actively gave up searching. As with U-5, the denominator is expanded to include the marginally attached, who are not technically part of the labor force.

The denominator for this ratio is the same as in U-5. The rate for December 2024 was 7.5.

Every month the Census Bureau, part of the Department of Commerce DOC, conducts the Current Population Survey CPS using a sample of approximately 60,000 households, or about 110,000 individuals. The survey includes information on race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, and gender. The sample is rotated so that 75 of the households remain constant from month to month and 50 from year to year. The surveys include industry information, occupations, average earnings, and union membership. For those who are jobless, interviewers also ask whether they quit or were fired or laid off. The survey excludes individuals under the age of 16 and those who are in the Armed Forces. People in correctional facilities, mental healthcare facilities, and similar institutions are also excluded. Interviewers ask questions that determine employment status but do not ask whether respondents are employed or unemployed. Nor do the interviewers assign employment status they record the answers for the BLS to analyze. Unemployment and the Economy Unemployment is one of the most closely-watched indicators for economic health, along with gross domestic product GDP and the consumer price index CPI . The unemployment rate has an inverse relationship with the stock market and inflation, two key metrics for the overall economy. A low unemployment rate tends to be associated with an increased average wage, due to the reduced labor supply. This can result in inflation , as employers raise prices to account for increased labor costs. Low unemployment also tends to be accompanied by increased stock prices, because the workforce has more disposable income. What Is the U.S. Unemployment Rate? The unemployment rate in the United States was 4.1 for December 2024. What Is a Healthy Unemployment Rate? Low unemployment is not considered healthy, as lower rates can be seen as inflationary due to pricing pressure on salaries however, high unemployment is not considered healthy, as higher rates can be seen as a financial strain on consumer spending. In general, most experts deem unemployment between 3 and 5 to be ideal, though there is no single consensus on what constitutes healthy unemployment. Whats the Difference Between U-3 and U-6 Unemployment Rates? U-3 is the headline unemployment number seen in the news. It looks at out-of-work Americans looking for employment within the past four weeks. The more comprehensive U-6 includes everyone in U-3 plus those with only temporary work and people considered marginally attached to the labor force. How Is U.S. Unemployment Data Collected? The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys approximately 60,000 households in person or over the phone. The responses are later aggregated by race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, and gender, all of whichalong with geographyadd greater detail to the employment picture. The Bottom Line In assessing an economys health, the nations unemployment rate plays a major factor in setting monetary policy and making strategic economic decisions. There are various ways to calculate unemployment , however, the general public is most familiar with the U-3 rate. The calculation for this iteration of the unemployment rate is to divide the number of unemployed individuals by the total workforce.",
