The term derivative refers to a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on an underlying asset , a group of assets, or a benchmark. Derivatives are agreements set between two or more parties that can be traded on an exchange or over the counter OTC . These contracts can be used to trade any number of assets and come with their own risks. Prices for derivatives derive from fluctuations in the prices of underlying assets. These financial securities are commonly used to access certain markets and may be traded to hedge against risk. Derivatives can be used to either mitigate risk hedging or assume risk with the expectation of commensurate reward speculation. Derivatives can move risk levels and the accompanying rewards from the risk-averse to the risk seekers . Key Takeaways Derivatives are financial contracts, set between two or more parties, that derive their value from an underlying asset, a group of assets, or a benchmark. A derivative can trade on an exchange or over the counter. Prices for derivatives derive from fluctuations in the prices of underlying assets. Derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, which increases their potential risks and rewards. Common derivatives include futures contracts, forwards, options, and swaps. Katie Kerpel Investopedia Understanding Derivatives A derivative is a complex financial security that is set between two or more parties. Derivatives can take many forms, from stock and bond derivatives to economic indicator derivatives . Traders may use derivatives to access specific markets and trade different assets. Typically, derivatives are considered a form of advanced investing. The most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds, commodities , currencies , interest rates , and market indexes . Contract values depend on changes in the prices of the underlying assetthe primary instrument . Derivatives can be used to hedge, speculate on the directional movement of an underlying asset, or leverage a position. These assets are commonly traded on exchanges or OTC, and can often be entered via an online broker . The Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME is among the worlds largest derivatives exchanges. Its important to remember that when companies hedge, theyre not speculating on the price of the commodity. Instead, the hedge is an attempt to limit existing risks. Each party has its profit or margin built into the price, and the hedge helps protect those profits from being eliminated by unfavorable market moves in the price of the underlying asset. OTC-traded derivatives generally carry a greater counterparty risk the danger that one of the parties involved in the transaction might not deliver on its obligations, or default . OTC contracts are privately negotiated between two counterparties and are unregulated. To hedge this risk, the investor could purchase a currency derivative to, for example, lock in a specific exchange rate. Derivatives that could be used to hedge forex risk include currency futures and currency swaps . Important Exchange-traded derivatives, such as options and futures, are standardized and more heavily regulated than those traded over the counter and can be freely bought and sold via most online brokers . Special Considerations Derivatives were originally used to ensure balanced exchange rates for internationally traded goods. International traders needed a system to account for the constantly changing values of national currencies . Assume a European investor has investment accounts that are all denominated in euros EUR. Lets say they purchase shares of a U.S. company through a U.S. exchange using U.S. dollars USD. This means they are now exposed to exchange rate risk while holding that stock. Exchange rate risk is the threat that the value of the euro will increase in relation to the USD. If this happens, any profits the investor realizes upon selling the stock become less valuable when they are converted back into euros. A speculator who expects the euro to appreciate vs. the dollar could profit by using a derivative that rises in value with the euro. When using derivatives to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset, the investor does not need to have the actual underlying asset in their portfolio . Fast Fact Many derivative instruments are leveraged, which means a small amount of capital is required to have a sizable position in the underlying asset. Types of Derivatives Derivatives today are based on a wide variety of underlying assets and have many uses, even exotic ones. For example, there are derivatives based on weather data, such as the amount of rain or the number of sunny days in a region. There are different types of derivatives that can be used for risk management , speculation , and leveraging a position. The derivatives market continues to grow, expanding with products to fit nearly any need or level of risk tolerance . There are two classes of derivative products lock and option . Lock products e.g., futures, forwards, or swaps bind the respective parties from the outset to the agreed-upon terms over the life of the contract. Option products e.g., stock options, on the other hand, offer the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset or security at a specific price on or before the options expiration date. The most common derivative types are futures, forwards, swaps, and options. Futures A futures contract , or simply futures, is an agreement between two parties for the purchase and delivery of an asset at an agreed-upon price at a future date. Futures are standardized contracts that trade on an exchange. Traders use futures to hedge their risk or speculate on the price of an underlying asset. The parties involved are obligated to fulfill a commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset. For example, say that on Nov. 6, 2025, Company A buys a futures contract for oil at a price of 62.22 per barrel that expires Dec. 19, 2025. The company does this because it needs oil in December and is concerned that the price will rise before the company needs to buy. Buying an oil futures contract hedges the companys risk because the seller is obligated to deliver oil to Company A for 62.22 per barrel once the contract expires. Assume oil prices rise to 80 per barrel by Dec. 19, 2025. Company A can accept delivery of the oil from the seller of the futures contract, but if it no longer needs the oil, it can also sell the contract before expiration and keep the profits. In this example, both the futures buyer and seller hedge their risk. Company A needed oil in the future and wanted to offset the risk that the price may rise in December with a long position in an oil futures contract. The seller could be an oil company concerned about falling oil prices that wanted to eliminate that risk by selling or shorting a futures contract that fixed the price it would get in December. It is also possible that one or both of the parties are speculators with the opposite opinions about the price of oil in December. In that case, one might benefit from the contract, and one might not. Take, for example, the futures contract for West Texas Intermediate WTI oil that trades on the CME and represents 1,000 barrels of oil. If the price of oil rose from 62.22 to 80 per barrel, the trader with the long positionthe buyerin the futures contract would have profited 17,780 80 - 62.22 1,000 17,780. The trader with the short positionthe sellerin the contract would have a loss of 17,780. Cash Settlements of Futures Not all futures contracts are settled at expiration by delivering the underlying asset. If both parties in a futures contract are speculating investors or traders , it is unlikely that either of them would want to make arrangements for the delivery of a large number of barrels of crude oil. Speculators can end their obligation to purchase or deliver the underlying commodity by closing unwinding their contract before expiration with an offsetting contract. Many derivatives are, in fact, cash-settled , which means that the gain or loss in the trade is simply an accounting cash flow to the traders brokerage account. Futures contracts that are cash-settled include many interest rate futures, stock index futures , and more unusual instruments such as volatility futures or weather futures . Forwards Forward contracts , or forwards, are similar to futures, but they do not trade on an exchange. These contracts only trade over the counter. When a forward contract is created, the buyer and seller may customize the terms, size, and settlement process. As OTC products, forward contracts carry a greater degree of counterparty risk. Counterparty risks are a type of credit risk where the parties involved may fail to deliver on the obligations outlined in the contract. If one party becomes insolvent, the other party may have no recourse and could lose the value of its position. Once created, the parties in a forward contract can offset their positions with other counterparties, which can increase the potential for counterparty risks as more traders become involved in the same contract. Swaps Swaps are another common type of derivatives, often used to exchange one kind of cash flow for another. For example, a trader might use an interest rate swap to switch from a variable interest rate loan to a fixed-interest-rate loan, or vice versa. Imagine that Company XYZ borrows 1,000,000 and pays a variable interest rate on the loan that is currently 6. XYZ may be concerned about rising interest rates that will increase the costs of this loan or encounter a lender that is reluctant to extend more credit while the company has this variable-rate risk. Assume XYZ creates a swap with Company QRS, which is willing to exchange the payments owed on the variable-rate loan for the payments owed on a fixed-rate loan of 7. That means that XYZ will pay 7 to QRS on its 1,000,000 principal, and QRS will pay XYZ 6 interest on the same principal. At the beginning of the swap, XYZ will just pay QRS the 1-percentage-point difference between the two swap rates . If interest rates fall so that the variable rate on the original loan is now 5, Company XYZ will have to pay Company QRS the 2-percentage-point difference on the loan. If interest rates rise to 8, then QRS would have to pay XYZ the 1-percentage-point difference between the two swap rates. Regardless of how interest rates change, the swap has achieved XYZs original objective of turning a variable-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan. Swaps can also be constructed to exchange currency risk or the risk of default on a loan or cash flows from other business activities. Swaps related to the cash flows and potential defaults of mortgage bonds are an extremely popular derivative. In fact, theyve been a bit too popular in the past. It was the counterparty risk of swaps like this that eventually spiraled into the credit crisis of 2008 . Options An options contract is similar to a futures contract in that it is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date for a specific price. The key difference between options and futures is that with an option, the buyer is not obliged to exercise their agreement to buy or sell. It is an opportunity only, not an obligation, as futures are. As with futures, options may be used to hedge or speculate on the price of the underlying asset. Tip In terms of timing your right to buy or sell, it depends on the style of the option. An American-style option allows holders to exercise the option rights anytime before and including the day of expiration. A European-style option can be executed only on the day of expiration. Most stocks and exchange-traded funds ETFs have American-style options, while equity indexes, including the SP 500, have European-style options. Imagine an investor owns 100 shares of a stock worth 50 per share. They believe the stocks value will rise in the future. However, this investor is concerned about potential risks and decides to hedge their position with an option. The investor could buy a put option that gives them the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock for 50 per shareknown as the strike price until a specific day in the futureknown as the expiration date . The option costs 2 per share. Each option contract represents 100 shares, so the investor paid 200 to enter this trade. Assume the stock falls in value to 40 per share by expiration and the put option buyer decides to exercise their option and sell the stock for the original strike price of 50 per share. As such, the investor only lost 200the price he paid for the options. An unhedged position wouldve shown a loss of 1,000. A strategy like this is called a protective put because it hedges the stocks downside risk. Alternatively, assume an investor doesnt own the stock currently worth 50 per share. They believe its value will rise over the next month. This investor could buy a call option that gives them the right to buy the stock for 50 before or at expiration. Assume this call option costs 2 per share, or 200 for the trade, and the stock rose to 60 before expiration. The buyer can now exercise their option and buy a stock worth 60 per share for the 50 strike price and record a gain of 10 per share. Subtracting 2 per share paid to enter the trade, and any broker fees, the investor is looking at approximately 800 net profit. In both examples, the sellers are obligated to fulfill their side of the contract if the buyers choose to exercise the contract. However, if a stocks price is above the strike price at expiration, the put option will be worthless and the seller the option writer gets to keep the premium at expiration. If the stocks price is below the strike price at expiration, the call will be worthless and the call seller will keep the premium. Melissa Ling Investopedia, 2019 Advantages and Disadvantages of Derivatives Advantages As the above examples illustrate, derivatives can be a useful tool for businesses and investors alike. They provide a way to Lock in prices Hedge against unfavorable movements in rates Mitigate risks These pluses can often come for a limited cost. Note Derivatives also can often be purchased on margin , which means traders use borrowed funds to purchase them. This makes them even less expensive. Disadvantages Derivatives can be difficult to value because they are based on the price of another asset. OTC derivatives also include counterparty risks that are difficult to predict. Additionally, most derivatives are sensitive to the following Changes in the amount of time until expiration Any costs associated with holding the underlying asset Interest rates These variables make it difficult to perfectly match the value of a derivative with the underlying asset. Because the derivative has no intrinsic valueits value comes only from the underlying assetit is vulnerable to market sentiment and market risks. Supply and demand factors can cause a derivatives price and its liquidity to rise and fall, regardless of what is happening with the price of the underlying asset. Finally, derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, and using leverage cuts both ways. While it can increase potential returns, it also makes losses mount quicker.

Derivatives are securities whose value is dependent on or derived from an underlying asset. For example, an oil futures contract is a type of derivative whose value is based on the market price of oil. Derivatives have become increasingly popular in recent decades, with the total value of derivatives outstanding estimated at 729.8 trillion on June 30, 2024. What Are Some Examples of Derivatives? Common examples of derivatives include futures contracts, options contracts, and credit default swaps . Beyond these, there is a vast quantity of derivative contracts tailored to meet the needs of a diverse range of counterparties. In fact, because many derivatives are traded over the counter OTC, they can in principle be infinitely customized. What Are the Main Benefits and Risks of Derivatives? Derivatives can be a very convenient way to achieve financial goals. For example, a company that wants to hedge against its exposure to commodities can do so by buying or selling energy derivatives such as crude oil futures. Similarly, a company could hedge its currency risk by purchasing currency-forward contracts. Derivatives can also help investors leverage their positions, such as by buying equities through stock options rather than shares. The main drawbacks of derivatives include counterparty risk, the inherent risks of leverage, and the fact that complicated webs of derivative contracts can lead to systemic risks . The Bottom Line A derivative is a type of financial contract that can be traded as an investment. Derivatives have no intrinsic value. Their worth comes entirely from the value of the underlying asset. Derivatives can be used to mitigate risk or to assume risk in the hope of achieving a reward. Regardless of your goal as an investor, derivatives come with potential downsides, including complexity, supply and demand factors, and vulnerability to market sentiment.",
