    "text": "What Is Inflation? Inflation is a gradual loss of purchasing power that is reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time. The inflation rate is calculated as the average price increase of a basket of selected goods and services over one year. High inflation means that prices are increasing quickly, while low inflation means that prices are growing more slowly. Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when prices decline and purchasing power increases. Key Takeaways Inflation measures how quickly the prices of goods and services are rising. Inflation is classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. The most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index. Inflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint and rate of change. Those with tangible assets may like to see some inflation as it raises the value of their assets. What Is Inflation? Understanding Inflation An increase in the money supply is the root of inflation, though this can play out through different mechanisms in the economy. A countrys money supply can be increased by the monetary authorities by Printing and giving away more money to citizens Legally devaluing reducing the value of the legal tender currency Loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market Other causes of inflation include supply bottlenecks and shortages of key goods, which can push prices to rise. When inflation occurs, money loses its purchasing power. This can occur across any sector or throughout an entire economy. The expectation of inflation itself can further sustain the devaluation of money. Workers may demand higher wages and businesses may charge higher prices, in anticipation of sustained inflation. This, in turn, reinforces the factors that push prices up. Melissa Ling Investopedia, 2019 Types of Inflation Inflation can be classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-Pull Effect Demand-pull inflation occurs when an increase in the supply of money and credit stimulates the overall demand for goods and services to increase more rapidly than the economys production capacity. This increases demand and leads to price rises. When people have more money, it leads to positive consumer sentiment. This, in turn, leads to higher spending, which pulls prices higher. It creates a demand-supply gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices. Cost-Push Effect Cost-push inflation is a result of the increase in prices working through the production process inputs. When additions to the supply of money and credit are channeled into a commodity or other asset markets, costs for all kinds of intermediate goods rise. This is especially evident when theres a negative economic shock to the supply of key commodities. These developments lead to higher costs for the finished product or service and work their way into rising consumer prices. For instance, when the money supply is expanded, it creates a speculative boom in oil prices . This means that the cost of energy can rise and contribute to rising consumer prices, which is reflected in various measures of inflation. Built-In Inflation Built-in inflation is related to adaptive expectations or the idea that people expect current inflation rates to continue in the future. As the price of goods and services rises, people may expect a continuous rise in the future at a similar rate. As such, workers may demand more costs or wages to maintain their standard of living. Their increased wages result in a higher cost of goods and services, and this wage-price spiral continues as one factor induces the other and vice versa. How Inflation Impacts Prices While it is easy to measure the price changes of individual products over time, human needs extend beyond just one or two products. Individuals need a big and diversified set of products as well as a host of services to live a comfortable life. They include commodities like food grains, metal, fuel, utilities like electricity and transportation, and services like healthcare , entertainment, and labor. Inflation aims to measure the overall impact of price changes for a diversified set of products and services. It allows for a single value representation of the increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a specified time. Prices rise, which means that one unit of money buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nations money supply growth outpaces economic growth. 3 The increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPI-U over the 12 months ending January 2025 on an unadjusted basis. Prices increased by 0.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis in January 2025 from the previous month. To combat this, the monetary authority in most cases, the central bank takes the necessary steps to manage the money supply and credit to keep inflation within permissible limits and keep the economy running smoothly. Theoretically, monetarism is a popular theory that explains the relationship between inflation and the money supply of an economy. For example, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, massive amounts of gold and silver flowed into the Spanish and other European economies. Since the money supply rapidly increased, the value of money fell, contributing to rapidly rising prices. Inflation is measured in a variety of ways depending on the types of goods and services. It is the opposite of deflation , which indicates a general decline in prices when the inflation rate falls below 0. Keep in mind that deflation shouldnt be confused with disinflation , which is a related term referring to a slowing down in the positive rate of inflation. Julie Bang Investopedia How to Protect Your Finances During Inflation There are a range of measures that individuals can take to protect their finances against inflation. For instance, one may choose to invest in asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary times. This might include commodities like grain, beef, oil, electricity, and natural gas. Commodity prices typically stay one step ahead of product prices, and price increases for commodities are often seen as an indicator of inflation to come. Commodities, which can also be volatile, are easily affected by natural disasters, geopolitics, or conflict. Real estate income may also help buffer against inflation, as landlords can increase their rent to keep pace with the rise of prices overall. The U.S. government also offers Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a type of security indexed to inflation to protect against declines in purchasing power. Types of Price Indexes Depending upon the selected set of goods and services used, multiple types of baskets of goods are calculated and tracked as price indexes. The most commonly used price indexes are the Consumer Price Index CPI and the Wholesale Price Index WPI . Consumer Price Index CPI The CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of goods and services that are of primary consumer needs. They include transportation, food, and medical care. CPI is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them based on their relative weight in the whole basket. The prices in consideration are the retail prices of each item, as available for purchase by the individual citizens. CPI can impact the value of one currency against those of other nations. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living , making it one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS reports the CPI each month and has calculated it as far back as 1913. Important The CPI-U, which was introduced in 1978, represents the buying habits of approximately 88 of the noninstitutional population of the United States. Wholesale Price Index WPI The WPI is another popular measure of inflation. It measures and tracks the changes in the price of goods in the stages before the retail level. While WPI items vary from one country to another, they mostly include items at the producer or wholesale level. For example, it includes cotton prices for raw cotton, cotton yarn, cotton gray goods, and cotton clothing. Although many countries and organizations use the WPI, many other countries, including the U.S., use a similar variant called the Producer Price Index PPI . Producer Price Index PPI The PPI is a family of indexes that measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers of intermediate goods and services over time. The PPI measures price changes from the perspective of the seller and differs from the CPI, which measures price changes from the perspective of the buyer. In all variants, the rise in the price of one component say oil may cancel out the price decline in another say wheat to a certain extent. Overall, each index represents the average weighted price change for the given constituents which may apply at the overall economy , sector, or commodity level. The Formula for Measuring Inflation The above-mentioned variants of price indexes can be used to calculate the value of inflation between two particular months or years. While a lot of ready-made inflation calculators are already available on various financial portals and websites, it is always better to be aware of the underlying methodology to ensure accuracy with a clear understanding of the calculations. Mathematically, Percent Inflation Rate Final CPI Index Value Initial CPI Value 100 Say you wish to know how the purchasing power of 10,000 changed between January 1975 and January 2024. One can find price index data on various portals in a tabular form. From that table, pick up the corresponding CPI figures for the given two months. For September 1975, it was 52.1 initial CPI value, and for January 2024, it was 308.417 final CPI value. Plugging in the formula yields Percent Inflation Rate 308.417 52.1 100 5.9197 100 591.97 Since you wish to know how much 10,000 from January 1975 would be worth in January 2024, multiply the inflation rate by the amount to get the changed dollar value Change in Dollar Value 5.9197 10,000 59,197 This means that 10,000 in January 1975 will be worth 59,197 today. Essentially, if you purchased a basket of goods and services as included in the CPI definition worth 10,000 in 1975, the same basket would cost you 59,197 in January 2024. Advantages and Disadvantages of Inflation Inflation can be construed as either a good or a bad thing, depending upon which side one takes, and how rapidly the change occurs. Advantages Individuals with tangible assets like property or stocked commodities priced in their home currency may like to see some inflation as that raises the price of their assets, which they can sell at a higher rate. Inflation often leads to speculation by businesses in risky projects and by individuals who invest in company stocks because they expect better returns than inflation. An optimum level of inflation is often promoted to encourage spending to a certain extent instead of saving. If the purchasing power of money falls over time, there may be a greater incentive to spend now instead of saving and spending later. It may increase spending, which may boost economic activities in a country. A balanced approach is thought to keep the inflation value in an optimum and desirable range. Disadvantages Buyers of such assets may not be happy with inflation, as they will be required to shell out more money. People who hold assets valued in their home currency, such as cash or bonds, may not like inflation, as it erodes the real value of their holdings. As such, investors looking to protect their portfolios from inflation should consider inflation-hedged asset classes, such as gold, commodities, and real estate investment trusts REITs. Inflation-indexed bonds are another popular option for investors to profit from inflation . High and variable rates of inflation can impose major costs on an economy. Businesses, workers, and consumers must all account for the effects of generally rising prices in their buying, selling, and planning decisions. This introduces an additional source of uncertainty into the economy, because they may guess wrong about the rate of future inflation. Time and resources expended on researching, estimating, and adjusting economic behavior are expected to rise to the general level of prices. Thats opposed to real economic fundamentals, which inevitably represent a cost to the economy as a whole. Even a low, stable, and easily predictable rate of inflation, which some consider otherwise optimal, may lead to serious problems in the economy. Thats because of how, where, and when the new money enters the economy. Whenever new money and credit enter the economy, it is always in the hands of specific individuals or business firms. The process of price level adjustments to the new money supply proceeds as they then spend the new money and it circulates from hand to hand and account to account through the economy. Inflation does drive up some prices first and drives up other prices later. This sequential change in purchasing power and prices known as the Cantillon effect means that the process of inflation not only increases the general price level over time but also distorts relative prices , wages, and rates of return along the way. Economists, in general, understand that distortions of relative prices away from their economic equilibrium are not good for the economy, and Austrian economists even believe this process to be a major driver of cycles of recession in the economy. Pros Leads to higher resale value of assets Optimum levels of inflation encourage spending Cons Buyers have to pay more for products and services Imposes higher prices on the economy Drives some prices up first and others later How Inflation Can Be Controlled A countrys financial regulator shoulders the important responsibility of keeping inflation in check. It is done by implementing measures through monetary policy , which refers to the actions of a central bank or other committees that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply. In the U.S., the Feds monetary policy goals include moderate long-term interest rates, price stability, and maximum employment. Each of these goals is intended to promote a stable financial environment. The Federal Reserve clearly communicates long-term inflation goals in order to keep a steady long-term rate of inflation , which is thought to be beneficial to the economy. Price stability or a relatively constant level of inflation allows businesses to plan for the future since they know what to expect. The Fed believes that this will promote maximum employment, which is determined by non-monetary factors that fluctuate over time and are therefore subject to change. For this reason, the Fed doesnt set a specific goal for maximum employment, and it is largely determined by employers assessments. Maximum employment does not mean zero unemployment, as at any given time there is a certain level of volatility as people vacate and start new jobs. Hyperinflation is often described as a period of inflation of 50 or more per month. Monetary authorities also take exceptional measures in extreme conditions of the economy. For instance, following the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Fed kept the interest rates near zero and pursued a bond-buying program called quantitative easing QE . Some critics of the program alleged it would cause a spike in inflation in the U.S. dollar, but inflation peaked in 2007 and declined steadily over the next eight years. There are many complex reasons why QE didnt lead to inflation or hyperinflation , though the simplest explanation is that the recession itself was a very prominent deflationary environment, and quantitative easing supported its effects. Consequently, U.S. policymakers have attempted to keep inflation steady at around 2 per year. The European Central Bank ECB has also pursued aggressive quantitative easing to counter deflation in the eurozone, and some places have experienced negative interest rates . Thats due to fears that deflation could take hold in the eurozone and lead to economic stagnation. Moreover, countries that experience higher rates of growth can absorb higher rates of inflation. Indias target is around 4 with an upper tolerance of 6 and a lower tolerance of 2, while Brazil aims for 3.25 with an upper tolerance of 4.75 and a lower tolerance of 1.75. Meaning of Inflation, Deflation, and Disinflation While a high inflation rate means that prices are increasing, a low inflation rate does not mean that prices are falling. Counterintuitively, when the inflation rate falls, prices are still increasing, but at a slower rate than before. When the inflation rate falls but remains positive, this is known as disinflation . Conversely, if the inflation rate becomes negative, that means that prices are falling. This is known as deflation , which can have negative effects on an economy. Because buying power increases over time, consumers have less incentive to spend money in the short term, resulting in falling economic activity. Hedging Against Inflation Stocks are considered to be the best hedge against inflation , as the rise in stock prices is inclusive of the effects of inflation. Since additions to the money supply in virtually all modern economies occur as bank credit injections through the financial system, much of the immediate effect on prices happens in financial assets that are priced in their home currency, such as stocks. Special financial instruments exist that one can use to safeguard investments against inflation. They include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a low-risk treasury security that is indexed to inflation where the principal amount invested is increased by the percentage of inflation. One can also opt for a TIPS mutual fund or TIPS-based exchange-traded fund ETF . To get access to stocks, ETFs, and other funds that can help avoid the dangers of inflation, youll likely need a brokerage account. Choosing a stockbroker can be a tedious process due to the variety among them. Gold is also considered to be a hedge against inflation, although this doesnt always appear to be the case looking backward. Examples of Inflation Since all world currencies are fiat money , the money supply could increase rapidly for political reasons, resulting in rapid price level increases. The most famous example is the hyperinflation that struck the German Weimar Republic in the early 1920s. The nations that were victorious in World War I demanded reparations from Germany, which could not be paid in German paper currency, as this was of suspect value due to government borrowing. Germany attempted to print paper notes, buy foreign currency with them, and use that to pay their debts. This policy led to the rapid devaluation of the German mark along with the hyperinflation that accompanied the development. German consumers responded to the cycle by trying to spend their money as fast as possible, understanding that it would be worth less and less the longer they waited. More money flooded the economy, and its value plummeted to the point where people would paper their walls with practically worthless bills. Similar situations occurred in Peru in 1990 and in Zimbabwe between 2007 and 2008. What Causes Inflation? There are three main causes of inflation demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-pull inflation refers to situations where there are not enough products or services being produced to keep up with demand, causing their prices to increase. Cost-push inflation, on the other hand, occurs when the cost of producing products and services rises, forcing businesses to raise their prices. Built-in inflation which is sometimes referred to as a wage-price spiral occurs when workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs. This, in turn, causes businesses to raise their prices in order to offset their rising wage costs, leading to a self-reinforcing loop of wage and price increases. Is Inflation Good or Bad? Too much inflation is generally considered bad for an economy, while too little inflation is also considered harmful. Many economists advocate for a middle ground of low to moderate inflation, of around 2 per year. Generally speaking, higher inflation harms savers because it erodes the purchasing power of the money they have saved however, it can benefit borrowers because the inflation-adjusted value of their outstanding debts shrinks over time. What Are the Effects of Inflation? Inflation can affect the economy in several ways. For example, if inflation causes a nations currency to decline, this can benefit exporters by making their goods more affordable when priced in the currency of foreign nations. On the other hand, this could harm importers by making foreign-made goods more expensive. Higher inflation can also encourage spending, as consumers will aim to purchase goods quickly before their prices rise further. Savers, on the other hand, could see the real value of their savings erode, limiting their ability to spend or invest in the future. Why Was Inflation So High in 2024? Inflation has remained elevated since 2022 when inflation rates around the world rose to their highest levels since the early 1980s. While there is no single reason for this rapid rise in global prices, a series of events worked together to boost inflation to such high levels. The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and other restrictions that greatly disrupted global supply chains, from factory closures to bottlenecks at maritime ports. Governments also issued stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits to counter the financial impact on individuals and small businesses. When vaccines became widespread and the economy bounced back, demand fueled in part by stimulus money and low interest rates quickly outpaced supply, which struggled to get back to pre-COVID levels. Russias unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Russia, limiting the worlds supply of oil and gas since Russia is a large producer of fossil fuels. Food prices also rose as Ukraines large grain harvests could not be exported. As fuel and food prices rose, it led to similar increases down the value chains. The Fed raised interest rates to combat the high inflation, which significantly came down in 2023, though it remains above pre-pandemic levels . The Bottom Line Inflation is a rise in prices, which results in the decline of purchasing power over time. Inflation is natural and the U.S. government targets an annual inflation rate of 2 however, inflation can be dangerous when it increases too much, too fast. Inflation makes items more expensive, especially if wages do not rise by the same levels of inflation. Additionally, inflation erodes the value of some assets, especially cash. Governments and central banks seek to control inflation through monetary policy.",

    "text": "Definition An interest rate is the price an entity pays for borrowing money or the fee they charge for lending it, expressed as a percentage. What Is an Interest Rate? The interest rate is the percentage of interest relative to the principal . It is either what lenders charge borrowers or what is earned from deposit accounts. The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis and is expressed as an annual percentage rate APR. An interest rate can also apply to a savings account or a certificate of deposit CD. In this case, a bank or credit union pays a percentage of the funds deposited to the account holder. Annual percentage yield APY refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts. Key Takeaways An interest rate also applies to the amount earned at a bank or credit union from a deposit account. Most mortgages use simple interest. However, some loans use compound interest, which is applied to the principal but also to the accumulated interest of previous periods. A loan that is considered low-risk by the lender will have a lower interest rate. A loan that is considered high-risk will have a higher interest rate. The APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. Savings accounts and CDs use compound interest. Investopedia Julie Bang Understanding Interest Rates In lending, interest is a charge to the borrower for the use of an asset. Assets borrowed can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and property. Because of this, an interest rate can be thought of as the cost of money. Higher interest rates make borrowing the same amount of money more expensive. Interest rates apply to most lending or borrowing transactions. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes, fund projects, launch or fund businesses, or pay for college tuition. Businesses take out loans to fund capital projects and expand their operations by purchasing fixed and long-term assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. Borrowed money is repaid either in a lump sum by a pre-determined date or in periodic installments. For loans, the interest rate is applied to the principal, which is the amount of the loan. The interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The money to be repaid is usually more than the borrowed amount since lenders require compensation for the loss of use of the money during the loan period. The lender could have invested the funds during that period instead of providing a loan, which would have generated income from the asset. The difference between the total repayment sum and the original loan is the interest charged. When the loan is considered to be low risk by the lender, the borrower will usually be charged a lower interest rate. If the loan is considered high risk, the interest rate that the borrower is charged will be higher. Important Risk is typically assessed when a lender looks at a potential borrowers credit score, which is why its important to have an excellent one if you want to qualify for the best loans. Simple Interest Rate If you take out a 300,000 loan from the bank and the loan agreement stipulates that the interest rate on the loan is 4 simple interest, this means that you will have to pay the bank the original loan amount of 300,000 4 x 300,000 300,000 12,000 312,000. The example above was calculated based on the annual simple interest formula, which is Simple interest principal x interest rate x time The individual who took out the loan will have to pay 12,000 in interest at the end of the year, assuming it was only a one-year lending agreement. If the loan was a 30-year mortgage, the interest payment will be Simple interest 300,000 x 4 x 30 360,000 A simple interest rate of 4 annually translates into an annual interest payment of 12,000. After 30 years, the borrower would have made 12,000 x 30 years 360,000 in interest payments. Compound Interest Rate Some lenders prefer the compound interest method, which means that the borrower pays even more in interest. Compound interest, also called interest on interest , is applied both to the principal and also to the accumulated interest made during previous periods. The bank assumes that at the end of the first year the borrower owes the principal plus interest for that year. The bank also assumes that at the end of the second year, the borrower owes the principal plus the interest for the first year plus the interest on interest for the first year. The interest owed when compounding is higher than the interest owed using the simple interest method. The interest is charged monthly on the principal, including accrued interest from the previous months. For shorter time frames, the calculation of interest will be similar for both methods. As the lending time increases, however, the disparity between the two types of interest calculations grows. Using the example above, at the end of 30 years, the total owed in interest is almost 673,019 on a 300,000 loan with a 4 interest rate. The following formula can be used to calculate compound interest Compound interest p x 1 interest rate n 1 where p principal n number of compounding periods Lets look at another example. Jayati takes out a three-year loan of 10,000 at an interest rate of 5, which compounds annually. In the end, as worked out in the calculation below, she pays 1,576.25 in interest on the loan 10,000 1 0.05 3 1 10,000 1.157625 1 1,576.25 Compound Interest and Savings Accounts When you save money using a savings account, compound interest is favorable. The interest earned on these accounts is compounded and serves as compensation to the account holder for allowing the bank to use the deposited funds. If, for example, you deposit 500,000 into a high-yield savings account , the bank can take 300,000 of these funds to use as a mortgage loan. To compensate you, the bank pays 5 interest into the account annually. So, while the bank is taking 8 from the borrower, it is giving 5 to you, the account holder, netting it 3 in interest. In effect, savers lend the bank money which, in turn, provides funds to borrowers in return for interest. APR vs. APY Interest rates on consumer loans are typically quoted as the annual percentage rate APR . This is the rate of return that lenders demand for the ability to borrow their money. For example, the interest rate on credit cards is quoted as an APR. In our example above, 4 is the APR for the mortgage . The APR does not consider compounded interest for the year. The annual percentage yield APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. This interest rate takes compounding into account. How Are Interest Rates Determined? The interest rate charged by banks is determined by a number of factors, including the state of the economy. A countrys central bank e.g., the Federal Reserve in the U.S. sets the interest rate, which each bank uses to determine the APR range they offer. When the central bank sets interest rates at a high level, the cost of debt rises. When the cost of debt is high, it discourages people from borrowing and slows consumer demand. Interest rates tend to rise with inflation . In a high-interest-rate economy, businesses have limited access to capital funding through debt, which can lead to economic contraction. Economies are often stimulated during periods of low interest rates because borrowers have access to loans at inexpensive rates. Since interest rates on savings are low, businesses and individuals are more likely to spend and purchase riskier investment vehicles such as stocks. This spending fuels the economy and provides an injection to capital markets leading to economic expansion. While governments prefer lower interest rates, they eventually lead to market disequilibrium where demand exceeds supply, causing inflation. When inflation occurs, interest rates increase, which may relate to Walras law . 6.85 The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in February 2025. This was slightly down from 6.90 a year earlier. Interest Rates and Race There is evidence that suggests that white people get approved more often for mortgages. Data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the most comprehensive publicly-available information on mortgage market activity, showed that Black, Hispanic, and Asian applicants were denied conventional mortgage loans in 2023 17.1, 12.1, and 9.7 of the time, respectively. The denial rate for white applicants, on the other hand, was lower at 6.8. Evidence of interest rate discrimination with mortgages has been confirmed by other sources, including Harvard University and the Urban Institute, which found in 2022 that the average Black homeowner gets charged an interest rate that is 33 basis points higher than the average white homeowner, and pays about 250 more per year in interest. Not everybody agrees with these findings. A study by economists at the Federal Reserve Board concluded that no racial group gets preferential treatment, leading its authors to speculate that reporting of disparities elsewhere may be due to many Black and Hispanic borrowers tending to choose slightly higher interest rates in return for lower up-front costs. The Federal Reserve Board believes discrimination is improving and credits this, in part, to a rise in automated underwriting and stricter enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Why Are Interest Rates on 30-year Loans Higher than on 15-year Loans? Interest rates are a function of the risk of default and the opportunity cost . Longer loans and debts are inherently more risky, as there is more time for the borrower to default. The same time, the opportunity cost is also larger over longer time periods, as the principal is tied up and cannot be used for any other purpose. How Does the Fed Use Interest Rates? The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, uses interest rates as a monetary policy tool. By increasing the cost of borrowing among commercial banks, the central bank can influence many other interest rates, such as those for personal loans, business loans, and mortgages. This makes borrowing more expensive in general, lowering the demand for money and cooling off a hot economy. Lowering interest rates, on the other hand, makes money easier to borrow, stimulating spending and investment. Why Do Bond Prices React Inversely to Interest Rate Changes? A bond is a debt instrument that typically pays a fixed rate of interest over its lifetime. Say that prevailing interest rates are 5. If a bond is priced at par 1,000 and has an interest rate coupon of 5, it will pay bondholders 50 a year. If interest rates rise to 10, new bonds issued will pay doublei.e., 100 per 1,000 in face value . An existing bond that only pays 50 will have to sell at a steep discount in order for somebody to want to buy it. Likewise, if interest rates drop to 1, new bonds will only pay 10 per 1,000 in face value. Hence, a bond that pays 50 will be in high demand and its price will be bid up quite high. The Bottom Line An interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. When you take out a loan, you are expected to pay the entity lending you money something extra as compensation. Likewise, if you deposit money in a savings account, the financial institution may reward you because it can use part of this money to make more loans to its customers. These charges or payments are called interest and are applied at a specified rate.",

    "text": "Definition A stock, also called an equity or a share, is an ownership stake in the corporation that issued it. What Are Stocks? A stock is a security that represents ownership of a fraction of the corporation that issued it. Units of stock are called shares and entitle the owner to a portion of the corporations profits equal to the number of shares owned. Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on public exchanges. The exchanges and the stocks that are listed on them are required to conform to government regulations meant to protect investors from fraudulent practices. Key Takeaways A stock is proof of ownership of a fractional percentage of the company that issued it. Corporations issue stock to raise money to operate or expand their businesses. There are two main types of stock common and preferred. Historically, stocks outperform most other investments over the long run. Understanding Stocks Corporations issue stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. The holder of stock, a shareholder, may have a claim to part of the companys assets and earnings. A shareholder is considered an owner of the issuing company, determined by the number of shares an investor owns relative to the number of outstanding shares . If a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares, that person would own and have a claim to 10 of the companys assets and earnings . Stockholders do not own a corporation, but corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons. Corporations file taxes, can borrow, can own property, and can be sued. The idea that a corporation is a person means that the corporation owns its assets . A corporate office full of chairs and tables belongs to the corporation, and not to the shareholders. Corporate property is legally separated from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability of both the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets sold, but a shareholders assets are not at risk. The court cannot force you to sell your shares, although the value of your shares may have fallen. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, they cannot sell the companys assets to pay their creditors . Shareholder A person, company, or institution that owns at least one share of a companys stock What Is Shareholder Ownership? What shareholders own are shares issued by the corporation, and the corporation owns the assets held by a firm. If you own 33 of the shares of a company, it is incorrect to assert that you own one-third of that company. However, you do own one-third of the companys shares. This is known as separation of ownership and control. Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive dividends if and when they are distributed, and the right to sell your shares to somebody else. If you own a majority of shares, your voting power increases so that you can indirectly control the direction of a company by appointing its board of directors. This becomes most apparent when one company buys another. The acquiring company buys all the outstanding shares. The board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the corporation and often does so by hiring professional managers, or officers, such as the chief executive officer CEO . Ordinary shareholders do not manage the company. The importance of being a shareholder is that you are entitled to a portion of the companys profits, which is the foundation of a stocks value. The more shares you own, the larger the portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, however, do not pay out dividends and instead reinvest profits back into growing the company. These retained earnings , however, are still reflected in the value of a stock. Tip Read about Investopedias 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special-issue print edition. How to Compare Common and Preferred Stock There are two main types of stock common and preferred . Common stock usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders meetings and to receive any dividends paid out by the corporation. Preferred stockholders generally do not have voting rights , though they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stockholders. For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before common shareholders and have priority if a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated. Fast Fact The first common stock ever issued was by the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Companies can issue new shares whenever there is a need to raise additional cash. This process dilutes the ownership and rights of existing shareholders provided that they do not buy any of the new offerings. Corporations can also engage in stock buybacks, which benefit existing shareholders because they cause their shares to appreciate in value. What Is the Difference Between Stocks and Bonds? Stocks are issued by companies to raise capital to grow the business or undertake new projects. There are important distinctions between whether somebody buys shares directly from the company when it issues them in the primary market or from another shareholder in the secondary market . When the corporation issues shares, it does so in return for money. Bonds vary from stocks in several ways. Bondholders are creditors to the corporation and are entitled to interest as well as repayment of the principal invested. Also, creditors are given legal priority over other stakeholders in the event of a bankruptcy and will be made whole first if a company is forced to sell assets . Conversely, shareholders often receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy, implying that stocks are inherently riskier investments than bonds. How Do You Buy Stock? Most often, stocks are bought and sold on stock exchanges , such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange NYSE. After a company goes public through an initial public offering IPO, its stock becomes available for investors to buy and sell on an exchange. Typically, investors will use a brokerage account to purchase stock on the exchange, which will list the purchasing price the bid or the selling price the offer. The price of the stock is influenced by supply and demand factors in the market, among other variables. How Can You Earn Income from Owning Stock? There are two ways to earn money by owning shares of stock through dividends and capital appreciation. Dividends are cash distributions of company profits. If a company has 1,000 shares outstanding and declares a 5,000 dividend, then stockholders will get 5 for each share they own. Capital appreciation is the increase in the share price itself. If you sell a share to someone for 10, and the stock is later worth 11, the shareholder has made 1. Is It Risky to Own Stock? All investments have a degree of risk . Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds ETFs can lose value if market conditions decline. When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions or corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company. Historically, stocks have outperformed most other investments over the long run. The Bottom Line A stock represents fractional ownership of equity in an organization. It is different from a bond, which operates like a loan made by creditors to the company in return for periodic payments. A company issues stock to raise capital from investors for new projects or to expand its business operations. The type of stock , common or preferred, held by a shareholder determines the rights and benefits of ownership.",

    "text": "Definition A bond is a fixed-income instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower thats typically a corporate or government entity. What Is a Bond? A bond is a fixed-income instrument and investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a certain interest rate for an amount of time. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower. Key Takeaways A bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate or coupon to debtholders. Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice-versa. Bonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default. Investopedia Ellen Lindner How Bonds Work Bonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure. Corporations often borrow to grow their business , buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees. Bonds are fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be paid back. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate . The initial price of most bonds is typically set at par or 1,000 face value per individual bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures. Fast Fact Markets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individualslong after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date . Characteristics of Bonds Face value or Par Value The value of the bond at maturity and the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments. Coupon Rate The rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage. Coupon Dates The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Maturity Date The date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond. Issue Price The price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In many cases, bonds are issued at par . Bond Categories There are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms. Corporate Bonds Companies issue corporate bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates. Municipal Bonds Issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors. Government Bonds Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called Bills, bonds issued with one10 years to maturity are called notes, and government bonds issued with more than 10 years to maturity are called bonds. The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as treasuries . Agency Bonds Issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are considered agency bonds . Bond Prices and Interest Rates A bonds price changes daily where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bonds price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa. The issuer of a fixed-rate bond promises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a 1,000 par, 10 annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder 100 each year. If prevailing market interest rates are also 10 at the time that this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return 100. However, if interest rates drop to 5, the investor can only receive 50 from the government bond but would still receive 100 from the corporate bond. Investors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environmentin this case, the bond will trade at 2,000 so that the 100 coupon represents 5. Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15, then an investor could make 150 from the government bond and would not pay 1,000 to earn just 100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case to a price of 666.67. Yield-to-Maturity YTM The yield-to-maturity YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate. YTM is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled. YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate. YTM. Investopedia Investors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1 change in interest rates. This practical definition is the modified duration of a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes. How To Invest in Bonds While there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and TIPS are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via its TreasuryDirect website. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds . Investors can also take a look at Investopedias list of the best online stock brokers . Image by Sabrina Jiang Â Investopedia 2020 Bond Variations The bonds available for investors come in many different varieties, depending on the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes. Zero-Coupon Bonds Z-bonds Do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. U.S. Treasury bills are zero-coupon bonds . Convertible Bonds Debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock equity at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price. Callable Bonds Have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond can be called back by the company before it matures. A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value. Puttable Bonds allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured. This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders. What Determines a Bonds Coupon Rate? Two features of a bondcredit quality and time to maturityare the principal determinants of a bonds coupon rate. If the issuer has a poor credit rating , the risk of default is greater, and these bonds pay more interest. Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed to interest rate and inflation risks for an extended period. How Are Bonds Rated? Credit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies like Standard and Poors , Moodys , and Fitch Ratings . The very highest quality bonds are called investment grade and include debt issued by the U.S. government and very stable companies, such as many utilities. Bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called high yield or junk bonds. These bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk. What Is Duration? Bonds and bond portfolios will rise or fall in value as interest rates change. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called duration . The use of the term duration in this context can be confusing to new bond investors because it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. Instead, duration describes how much a bonds price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates. The Bottom Line Bonds are issued by companies and governments to finance projects and fund operations. A bond is considered a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate to debtholders. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers or buy government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website.",

In a mutual fund, investors pool their money to buy assets together, benefiting from shared costs and professional expertise. Rather than buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy shares in the fund itself, becoming partial owners of all its holdings. When you invest in a mutual fund, youre essentially hiring professional money managers to make investment decisions on your behalf. These managers research opportunities, select securities, and monitor performance according to the funds stated objectiveswhether thats aggressive growth, steady income, or matching a market index. Key Takeaways Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to build diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds and other securities managed by finance professionals. Fund shares are priced once daily at market close based on the net asset value NAV of all holdings minus expenses divided by total shares. Investors can earn returns through capital gains when fund holdings increase in value, dividend and interest distributions, or selling shares for a profit. Key benefits include professional management, diversification, and relatively low investment minimums, though fees and expenses can impact returns. Most Americans invest in mutual funds through employer retirement plans like 401ks, with over half of U.S. households owning fund shares. Investopedia Ellen Lindner Mutual Funds How Many is Too Many? How Mutual Funds Work Mutual funds are portfolios of investments funded by all those who have bought shares in the fund. When someone buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all the funds underlying assets. The funds performance depends on its assetsif its full of stocks going up, it will go up. If theyre going down, so, too, will the fund. While a mutual fund manager oversees the portfolio, deciding how to divide money across sectors, industries, companies, etc., based on the funds strategy, many mutual funds are so-called index or passive funds , with portfolios that shouldnt need too much management. They simply mirror the assets of indexes like the SP 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The biggest fund managers are Vanguard and Fidelity . Tip The reason mutual funds are so often the default for retirement accounts like 401ks is that they let you instantly diversify across hundreds of securities with a relatively modest amount of money. The number of American households invested in mutual funds has increased significantly since they were introduced about half a century ago, from about 6 of households in 1980 to about 53 in the mid-2020s, including about 35 of Gen Z households. Together, American households own about 88 of all mutual fund assets. Mutual funds give everyday investors access to a diverse investment menu they likely couldnt build on their own. Rather than putting all your money into one stock or bondwhich can be riskya mutual fund spreads your investments across many different securities. How To Invest in Mutual Funds Investing in mutual funds is relatively straightforward, involving the following steps Before buying shares, you should check with your employer to see if they offer mutual funds through your 401k or other retirement funds since these might have matching fundsessentially doubling what you put in. Once you know you wont be investing in mutual funds through work, make sure you have a brokerage account with enough deposited to buy the mutual fund shares you want. Identify mutual funds that match your investing goals regarding risk, returns, fees, and minimum investments. Many platforms offer fund screening tools. Determine how much you want to invest and submit your trade. To increase your investment over time, you can often set up automatic periodic purchases of shares. While these investments are often long-term, you should periodically check the funds performance and adjust as needed. When its time to close your position, enter a sell order on your platform. Types of Mutual Funds There are many types among the more than 8,800 mutual funds in the U.S., with most in four main categories stock, money market, bond, and target-date funds. Target Date Funds The Set-It-and-Forget-It Approach Target date funds offer a straightforward approach to retirement investing by automatically adjusting their mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on when you plan to retire. These mutual funds, which often have years like 2045 or 2050 in their names, start with aggressive growth strategies and gradually become more conservative as you approach retirement. These funds require active managementbut not from you. Earlier in your career, the fund might invest 90 of your money in stocks for growth potential. As you near retirement, it shifts more money into bonds and cash to help protect your nest egg from market swings. For example, a 30-year-old planning to retire in 2065 might choose a 2065 Target Date Fund. Initially, this fund would primarily hold stocks. Over time, it automatically rebalances to include more conservative investments, cutting down on risk when you can least afford major losses. However, target date funds arent one-size-fits-all. Their fees can vary significantly, and their investment strategiesknown as glide pathsdiffer among fund companies. Some funds maintain significant stock exposure even after retirement, while others take a more conservative approach. Important More than 90 of employee retirement plans in the U.S. use target date funds as their default. Stock Funds This type of fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are assorted subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in firms with small-, mid-, or large-sized capitalization . Others are named by their investment approach aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in U.S. stocks or foreign equities. To understand how these strategies and sizes of assets can combine, you can use an equity-style box like the example below. Value funds invest in stocks their managers see as undervalued while aiming at long-term appreciation when the market recognizes the stocks true worth. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings PE ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and dividend yields. Meanwhile, growth funds look to companies with solid earnings, sales, and cash flow growth. These companies typically have high price-to-earnings ratios and do not pay much in dividends. A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a blend. These funds invest in a mix of growth and value stocks to give a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in the middle. InvestopediaJulie Bang Large-cap companies have market capitalizations of over 10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically for blue-chip firms whose names are recognizable. Small-cap stocks have a market cap between 250 million and 2 billion. These companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Mid-cap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap. A mutual fund may combine different investment styles and company sizes. For example, a large-cap value fund might include in its portfolio large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall these would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box large and value. The opposite of this would be a small-cap growth fund that invests in startup technology companies with high growth prospects. This kind of fund is in the bottom right quadrant above small and growth. Bond Funds A mutual fund that generates a consistent and minimum return is part of the fixed-income category. These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments . The bonds should generate interest income thats passed on to the shareholders, with limited investment risk. There are also actively managed funds that look for relatively undervalued bonds to sell them at a profit. These mutual funds will likely pay higher returns but arent without risk. For example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities. Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where and when they invest, and all bond funds have interest rate risk . Tip Most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies or fund families such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer. Index Funds Index mutual funds are designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the SP 500. This passive strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so fewer expenses are passed on to investors through fees, and these funds are designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind. They also frequently outperform actively managed mutual funds and thus potentially are the rare combination in life of lower costs and better performance. Balanced Funds Balanced funds invest across different securities, whether stocks, bonds, the money market , or alternative investments. The objective of these funds, known as an asset-allocation fund, is to cut risk through diversification. Money Market Funds The money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. The returns on them arent substantial. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the average certificate of deposit CD . Money market mutual funds are often used as a temporary holding place for cash that will be used for future investments or for an emergency fund. While low risk, they arent insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC like savings accounts or CDs. Income Funds Income funds are meant to disburse income on a steady basis, and are often seen as the mutual funds for retirement investing. They invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. While fund holdings may rise in value, the primary goal is to offer a steady cash flow. International Funds An international mutual fund , or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investors home country. Global funds, however, can invest anywhere worldwide. Their volatility depends on where and when the funds are invested. Sector and Theme Funds Sector mutual funds aim to profit from the performance of specific industries, such as finance, technology, or healthcare. Theme funds can cut across sectors. For example, a fund focused on AI might have holdings in firms in healthcare, defense, and other areas employing and building out AI beyond the tech industry. Socially Responsible Mutual Funds Socially responsible investing invest only in companies and sectors that meet preset criteria. For example, some socially responsible funds do not invest in industries like tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power. Sustainable mutual funds invest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling. There are also funds that review environmental, social, and governance factors when choosing investments. This approach focuses on the companys management practices and whether they tend toward environmental and community improvement. Top Mutual Funds Below are five large mutual funds that represent a range of the types of funds listed above Vanguard 500 Index Fund VFIAX The oldest such mutual fund, VFIAX tracks the SP 500 Index , making it a way to invest in 500 of Americas largest companies with a single purchase. With a very low 0.04 expense ratio meaning you pay 40 cents annually per 1,000 invested, it requires a 3,000 minimum investment. Since its launch half a century ago, the fund has returned an average of about 8.27 annually. Fidelity 500 Index Fund FXAIX Like Vanguards offering, it charges even less, just 0.015 in annual expenses 15 cents per 1,000 invested and has no minimum investment requirement. The fund invests in technology, financial, healthcare and consumer companies, closely matching the SP 500 index while maintaining flexibility to invest up to 20 outside the index. T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund PRDGX This actively managed fund focuses on companies that consistently pay and increase their regular cash payments to shareholders. While its 0.64 expense ratio is higher than index funds, the strategy targets stable, financially healthy companies. The minimum investment is 2,500. Fidelity ZERO International Index Fund FZILX For investors seeking global diversification, this fund offers exposure to non-U.S. companies with no fees, a 0 expense ratio. The fund focuses on established international companies to help manage risk while providing worldwide investment exposure. Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund VBTLX This fund provides broad exposure to U.S. bonds, primarily government, and high-quality corporate debt. With a 0.05 expense ratio and a 3,000 minimum investment, its designed to provide steady income and help balance out the stock markets risks. Tip While many mutual funds are no-load, you can frequently avoid brokerage fees and commissions anyway by purchasing a fund directly from the mutual fund company instead of going through an intermediary. How Mutual Fund Shares Are Priced The value of the mutual fund depends on the performance of the securities it invests in. When buying a unit or share of a mutual fund, you get a part of its portfolio value. Investing in a share of a mutual fund differs from investing in stock shares. Unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give their holders voting rights. And unlike exchange-traded funds ETFs, you cant trade your shares throughout the trading day. Mutual fund share prices come from the net asset value NAV per share, sometimes listed as NAVPS . A funds NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the number of shares outstanding. Mutual fund shares are typically bought or redeemed at the funds NAV, which doesnt fluctuate during market hours but is settled at the end of each trading day. The price of a mutual fund is also updated when the NAVPS is settled. How Are Earnings Calculated for Mutual Funds? Investors typically earn returns from a mutual fund in three ways Dividendinterest income Mutual funds distribute the dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in its portfolio. Funds often give investors the choice of either receiving a deposit for distributions or reinvesting earnings for more shares in the mutual fund. Portfolio distributions If the fund sells securities that have increased in price, the fund realizes a capital gain , which most funds also pass on to investors in a distribution. Capital gains distribution When the funds shares increase in price, you can sell your mutual fund shares for a profit in the market. When researching the returns of a mutual fund, youll typically come upon a figure for the total return, or the net change in value either up or down over a specific period. This includes any interest, dividends, or capital gains the fund has generated along with the change in its market value during a given period. In most cases, total returns are given for one, five, and 10-year periods, as well as from the day the fund opened. Pros and Cons of Investing in Mutual Funds There are many reasons that mutual funds have been the retail investors vehicle of choice , with an overwhelming majority of money in employer-sponsored retirement plans invested in mutual funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular, has long paid very close attention to how these funds are run, given their importance to so many Americans and their retirements. Mutual Fund Pros Cons Pros Ability to buy and sell shares relatively quickly Diversification Minimal investment requirements Professional management Variety of offerings Cons Fees, commissions, and other expenses Large cash presence in portfolios No FDIC coverage Difficulty in comparing funds Lack of transparency in holdings Pros of Mutual Fund Investing Diversification A diversified portfolio has securities with different capitalizations and industries and bonds with varying maturities and issuers. A mutual fund can achieve diversification faster and more cheaply than buying individual securities. Ease of Access Trading on the major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. Also, for certain types of assets, like foreign equities or exotic commodities , mutual funds are often the most workablesometimes the onlyway for individual investors to participate. Economies of Scale Because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs are lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions. A mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could. Professional Management A mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. Mutual funds require much lower investment minimums, providing a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management. Transparency Mutual funds are subject to industry regulations meant to ensure accountability and fairness for investors. In addition, the component securities of each mutual fund can be found across many platforms. Tip Mutual fund managers are legally obligated to follow the funds stated mandate and to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders. Cons of Mutual Fund Investing Liquidity , diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options. However, there are drawbacks No FDIC Guarantee Like many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund will depreciate . Equity mutual funds experience price fluctuations, along with the stocks in the funds portfolio. The FDIC does not guarantee mutual fund investments. Cash Drag To maintain liquidity and the ability to accommodate withdrawals, mutual funds typically have to keep a larger percentage of their portfolio as cash than other investors. Because this cash earns no return, its called a cash drag. Higher Costs Fees that reduce your overall payout from a mutual fund are assessed whatever the performance of the fund. Failing to pay attention to the fees can cost you since actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate and compound year over year. Dilution Dilution is also the result of a successful fund growing too big. When new money pours into funds with solid track records, the manager could have trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use. The SEC requires that funds have at least 80 of assets in the particular type of investment implied by their title. How the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager. However, the categories that qualify for 80 of the assets can be vague and wide-ranging. End-of-Day Trading Only A mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash at any time. However, unlike stocks and ETFs that trade throughout the day, mutual fund redemptions can only take place at the end of the trading day. Taxes When the mutual fund manager sells a security, a capital-gains tax is triggered, which can be extended to you. ETFs, for example, avoid this through their creation and redemption mechanism. Your taxes can be lowered by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in a tax-deferred account, such as a 401k or IRA . Mutual Fund Fees When investing in mutual funds, its essential to understand the fees associated with them since these costs will significantly affect your investment returns over time. Here are some common mutual fund fees Expense ratio This is an annual fee that covers the funds operating expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and marketing expenses. The expense ratio is given as a percentage of the funds average net assets and is deducted from the funds returns. Pressured by competition from index investing and ETFs, mutual funds have lowered the expense ratio by more than half over the last 30 years see below. Sales charges or loads Some mutual funds charge sales fees, known as loads , when you buy or sell shares. Front-end loads are charged when you buy shares, while back-end loads or contingent and deferred sales charges are assessed if you sell your shares before a certain date. Sometimes, however, management firms offer no-load mutual funds , which dont have commission or sales charges. Redemption fees Some mutual funds charge a redemption fee when you sell shares within a short period usually 30 to 180 days after purchasing them, which the SEC limits to 2. This fee is designed to discourage short-term trading in these funds for stability. Other account fees Some funds or brokerage firms may charge extra fees for maintaining your account or transactions, especially if your balance falls below a certain minimum. Evaluating Mutual Funds Researching and comparing funds can be more difficult than for other securities. Unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price-to-earnings PE ratio, sales growth, earnings per share , or other important data. A mutual funds NAV can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. Only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely comparable. Watch Out for Diworsification Diworsification a play on words that defines the conceptis an investment term for when too much complexity can lead to worse results. Many mutual fund investors tend to over-complicate matters. That is, they acquire too many funds that are too similar and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification. Mutual Funds vs. Index Funds Index funds are mutual funds that aim to replicate the performance of a market benchmark or index. For example, an SP 500 index fund tracks that index by holding the 500 companies in the same proportions. A key goal of index funds is minimizing costs to mirror their index closely. By contrast, actively managed mutual funds try to beat the market by stock picking and shifting allocations. The fund manager seeks to achieve returns greater than a benchmark through their investing strategy and research. Index funds offer market returns at lower costs, while active mutual funds aim for higher returns through skilled management that often comes at a higher price. When deciding between index or actively managed mutual fund investing, investors should consider costs, time horizons, and risk appetite. Mutual Funds vs. ETFs Mutual funds and ETFs are pooled investment funds that offer investors a stake in a diversified portfolio. However, there are some crucial differences. Among the most important is that ETF shares are traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks, while mutual fund shares are traded only once daily after markets close. This means ETFs can be traded anytime during market hours, offering more liquidity, flexibility, and real-time pricing. This flexibility means you can short sell them or engage in the many strategies you would use for stocks. Another significant difference is pricing and valuation. ETF prices, like stocks, fluctuate throughout the day according to supply and demand. Meanwhile, mutual funds are priced only at the end of each trading day based on the NAV of the underlying portfolio. This also means that ETFs have the potential for larger premiumsdiscounts to NAV than mutual funds. Compared with mutual funds , ETFs tend to have certain tax advantages and are often more cost-efficient. Are Mutual Funds Safe Investments? All investments involve some degree of risk when purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual fundsand the actual risk of a particular mutual fund will depend on its investment strategy, holdings, and managers competence. Unlike deposits at banks and credit unions, the money invested in mutual funds isnt FDIC or otherwise insured. Can I Withdraw Money From a Mutual Fund Anytime? Yes. Mutual funds are generally highly liquid investments, meaning you can redeem your shares on any business day. However, there may be fees or penalties associated with early withdrawals, such as redemption fees or short-term trading fees, which some funds impose to discourage people from frequently trading in and out of the funds. Withdrawing funds may have tax implications, particularly if the investment has appreciated in value, which means youll have to pay taxes on the capital gains. Do You Actually Make Money in Mutual Funds? Yes, many make money for retirement and other savings goals through capital gains distributions, dividends, and interest income. As securities in the mutual funds portfolio increase in value, the value of the funds shares typically rises, leading to capital gains. However, returns are not guaranteed, and the performance of a mutual fund depends on market conditions, the funds management, what assets it holds, and its investment strategy. What Are the Risks of Mutual Funds? Depending on the assets they hold, mutual funds carry several investment risks, including market, interest rate, and management risk . Market risk arises from the potential decline in the value of the securities within the fund. Interest rate risk affects funds holding bonds and other fixed-income securities, as rising interest rates can decrease bond prices. Management risk is linked to the performance of the funds management team. You are putting your money in their hands, and poor investment decisions will negatively impact your returns. The Bottom Line Mutual funds are versatile and accessible for those looking to diversify their portfolios. These funds pool money from investors for stocks, bonds, real estate, derivatives, and other securitiesall managed for you. Key benefits include access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios and choosing funds tailored to different objectives and risk tolerances. However, mutual funds come with fees and expenses, including annual fees, expense ratios, or commissions, that will help determine your overall returns. Investors can choose from many types of mutual funds, such as stock, bond, money market, index, and target-date funds, each with its investment focus and strategy. The returns on mutual funds come from dividends or interest and selling fund shares at a profit.",

    "text": "Definition An exchange-traded fund pools a group of securities into a fund and can be traded like an individual stock on an exchange. What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund ETF? An exchange-traded fund ETF is an investment fund that holds multiple underlying assets and can be bought and sold on an exchange, much like an individual stock. ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of stockseven specific investment strategies. Various ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, or hedging risk in an investors portfolio . The first ETF in the U.S. was the SPDR SP 500 ETF SPY , which tracks the SP 500 Index . Key Takeaways An exchange-traded fund is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock. ETF share prices fluctuate throughout the trading day unlike mutual funds, which only trade once a day after the market closes. ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer brokerage commissions than buying stocks individually. Investopedia Zoe Hansen How ETFs Work An ETF must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. In the United States, most ETFs are set up as open-ended funds and are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements. Open-ended funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product. Vanguards Consumer Staples ETF VDC tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 2550 Index and has a minimum investment of 1.00. The fund holds shares of all 104 companies on the index, some familiar to most because they produce or sell consumer items. A few of the companies held by VDC are Proctor Gamble, Costco, Coca-Cola, Walmart, and PepsiCo. There is no transfer of ownership because investors buy a share of the fund, which owns the shares of the underlying companies. Unlike mutual funds, ETF share prices are determined throughout the day. A mutual fund trades only once a day after the markets close. Important Volatility is limited with an ETF because its holdings are diversified. Industry ETFs are also used to rotate in and out of sectors during economic cycles . Cash Invested in ETFs by Year Types of ETFs Passive ETFs Passive ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a broader indexeither a diversified index such as the SP 500 or a more targeted sector or trend. Actively managed ETFs These ETFs dont target an index. Instead, portfolio managers make decisions about which securities to buy and sell. Actively managed ETFs have benefits over passive ETFs but charge higher fees. Bond ETFs Used to provide regular income to investors. Distribution depends on the performance of underlying bonds which may include government, corporate, and state and local bonds, usually called municipal bonds . Unlike their underlying instruments, bond ETFs do not have a maturity date. Industry or sector ETFs A basket of stocks that track a single industry or sector like automotive or energy. The aim is to provide diversified exposure to a single industry, one that includes high performers and new entrants with growth potential. BlackRocks iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW , for example, tracks the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.545 Capped Index. Commodity ETFs Invest in commodities like crude oil or gold. Commodity ETFs can diversify a portfolio. Holding shares in a commodity ETF is cheaper than physical possession of the commodity. Currency ETFs Track the performance of currency pairs and can be used to speculate on the exchange rates of currencies based on political and economic developments in a country. Some use them to diversify a portfolio while importers and exporters use them to hedge against volatility in currency markets. Bitcoin ETFs The spot Bitcoin ETF was approved by the SEC in 2024 . These ETFs expose investors to bitcoins price moves in their regular brokerage accounts by purchasing and holding bitcoin as the underlying asset. Bitcoin futures ETFs , approved in 2021, use futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and track the price movements of bitcoin futures contracts. Ethereum ETFs Spot ether ETFs provide a way to invest in ether , the currency native to the Ethereum blockchain, without directly owning the cryptocurrency. In May 2024, the SEC permitted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the NYSE to list ETFs holding ether. And in July 2024 , the SEC officially approved nine spot ether ETFs to begin trading on U.S. exchanges. Inverse ETFs Earn gains from stock declines without having to short stocks . An inverse ETF uses derivatives to short a stock. Inverse ETFs are exchange-traded notes ETNs and not true ETFs. An ETN is a bond that trades like a stock and is backed by an issuer such as a bank. Leveraged ETFs A leveraged ETF seeks to return some multiples e.g., 2 or 3 on the return of the underlying investments. If the SP 500 rises 1, a 2 leveraged SP 500 ETF will return 2 and if the index falls by 1, the ETF would lose 2. These products use debt and derivatives, such as options or futures contracts, to leverage their returns. Fast Fact There are 10 ETFs focused on companies engaged in gold mining, excluding inverse and leveraged ETFs and those with relatively low assets under management AUM . Pros and Cons of ETFs Pros Exposure to many stocks across various industries Low expense ratios and commissions Risk management through diversification Can focus on targeted industries or commodities Cons Actively managed ETFs have higher fees Single-industry-focused ETFs limit diversification Lack of liquidity hinders transactions How to Invest in ETFs ETFs trade through online brokers and traditional broker-dealers . Many sources provide pre-screened brokers in the ETF industry. Individuals can also purchase ETFs in their retirement accounts. An alternative to standard brokers is a robo-advisor like Betterment and Wealthfront . An ETFs expense ratio is the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically have low expenses because they track an index. ETFs are available on most online investing platforms, retirement account provider sites, and investing apps like Robinhood. Most of these platforms offer commission-free trading, meaning that investors dont have to pay fees to the platform providers to buy or sell ETFs. After creating and funding a brokerage account, investors can search for ETFs and buy and sell as wanted. One of the best ways to narrow ETF options is to utilize an ETF screening tool with criteria such as trading volume, expense ratio, past performance, holdings, and commission costs.

Some ETFs track an index of stocks , thus creating a broad portfolio, while others target specific industries. SPDR SP 500 SPY The oldest and most widely known ETF tracks the SP 500. iShares Russell 2000 IWM An ETF that tracks the Russell 2000 small-cap index. Invesco QQQ QQQ Known as cubes, tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average DIA Known as diamonds, tracks the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA . Sector ETFs ETFs that track individual industries and sectors such as oil OIH , energy XLE , financial services XLF , real estate investment trusts IYR , and biotechnology BBH . Commodity ETFs These ETFs track commodities, including gold GLD , silver SLV , crude oil USO , and natural gas UNG . Country ETFs Funds that track the primary stock indexes in foreign countries but are traded in the U.S. in dollars. Examples include China MCHI , Brazil EWZ , Japan EWJ , and Israel EIS . Others track foreign markets across multiple countries, such as emerging market economies EEM and developed market economies EFA . ETFs vs. Mutual Funds vs. Stocks Most stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds can be bought and sold without a commission. Funds and ETFs differ from stocks because some of them charge management fees, though fees have been trending lower for years. ETFs tend to have lower fees than mutual funds. Exchange-Traded Funds Mutual Funds Stocks What They Are Track a basket of securities or commodities. Pooled investments into bonds, securities, and other instruments. Shares in listed companies. Prices Can trade at a premium or at a loss to the net asset value NAV of the fund. Trade at the net asset value of the overall fund. Based on their actual performance in the markets. How Theyre Traded Traded during regular market hours, just like stocks. Can be bought and sold only at the end of a trading day. Traded during regular market hours. Fees Can be purchased commission-free and are generally cheaper than mutual funds. Some do not charge load fees, but most are more expensive than ETFs because they charge management fees. Can be purchased commission-free on some platforms and generally do not have charges associated with them after purchase. Ownership of Securities ETFs do not involve actual ownership of securities by retail investors. Mutual funds own the securities in their basket. Stocks involve ownership of the security. Risk Diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and instruments. Diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and security instruments. Risk is concentrated in a stocks performance. Diversity would have to be achieved by buying other stocks. Active vs. Passive Equity Funds Dividends and Taxes ETF investors can also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated to investors. ETF shareholders are entitled to a share of earned interest or dividends and may get a residual value if the fund is liquidated . An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund because most buying and selling occur through an exchange, and the ETF sponsor doesnt need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell shares of the ETF. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares, they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund. Creation and Redemption The supply of ETF shares is regulated through creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors called authorized participants APs . When an ETF manager wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the indexsuch as the SP 500 tracked by the fundand sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit. When an AP sells stocks to the ETF sponsor in return for shares in the ETF, the block of shares used in the transaction is called a creation unit . If an ETF closes with a share price of 101 and the value of the stocks that the ETF owns is only worth 100 on a per-share basis, then the funds price of 101 was traded at a premium to the funds net asset value NAV . The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF. An AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process called redemption . The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the funds assets. ETFs in the United Kingdom The U.K. ETF market is one of the largest and most diverse in Europe. ETFs listed on the London Stock Exchange LSE offer exposure to various asset classes and markets, including equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, real estate, and alternative investments. Buying ETFs in the U.K. allows inclusion in Individual Savings Accounts ISAs, which are tax-efficient savings vehicles that allow people to invest up to 20,000 per year without paying any income or capital gains tax on their returns. Another benefit is that ETFs attract no stamp duty, which is a tax levied on ordinary share transactions in the U.K. Investors can buy shares in U.S.-listed companies from the U.K., but regulations prohibit the purchase of U.S.-listed ETFs in the U.K. Some U.K.-based ETFs track U.S. markets they have UCITS Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities in their name. This means the fund is fully regulated in the U.K. and allowed to track U.S. investments. Several ETFs track the FTSE 100 index for broad exposure to U.K. equities. These consist of the 100 largest publicly listed companies in the country. The HSBC FTSE UCITS ETF is listed on the London Stock Exchange and trades under the ticker symbol HUKX. The ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.07 and a dividend yield of 3.56 as of April 2025. What Was the First Exchange-Traded Fund? The distinction of being the first exchange-traded fund is often given to the SPDR SP 500 ETF SPY launched by State Street Global Advisors on Jan. 22, 1993. There were, however, some precursors to SPY, including Index Participation Units listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX , which tracked the Toronto 35 Index and appeared in 1990. How Is an ETF Different From an Index Fund? An index fund usually refers to a mutual fund that tracks an index. An index ETF is constructed in much the same way and will hold the stocks of an index. However, the difference between an index fund and an ETF is that an ETF tends to be more cost-effective and liquid than an index mutual fund. You can also buy an ETF throughout the trading day, while a mutual fund trades via a broker after the close of each trading day. Do ETFs Provide Diversification? Nearly all ETFs provide diversification relative to an individual stock purchases. Still, some ETFs are highly concentratedeither in the number of different securities they hold or in the weighting of those securities. For example, a fund may concentrate half of its assets in two or three positions, offering less diversification than other funds with broader asset distribution. The Bottom Line Exchange-traded funds represent a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a broad basket of securities with a limited budget. Investors can build a portfolio that holds one or many ETFs . Instead of buying individual stocks, investors buy shares of a fund that targets a representative cross-section of the wider market. However, there can be additional expenses to keep in mind when investing in an ETF.",

    "text": "Definition An index is a collection of a group of assets such as stocks and bonds thats used to track the performance of a specific sector or the broader market. What Is an Index? A financial index produces a numeric score based on inputs such as a variety of asset prices. It can be used to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market. These could be constructed as a broad-based index that captures the entire market, such as the Standard Poors 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, or more specialized, such as indexes that track a particular industry or segment, such as the Russell 2000 Index, which tracks only small-cap stocks. Key Takeaways Indexes in financial markets are often used as benchmarks to evaluate an investments performance against. Some of the most important indices in the U.S. markets are the SP 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Passive index investing has become a popular low-cost way to replicate the returns of popular indices such as the SP 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average. Benchmarking your investment strategy against the appropriate index is key to understanding a portfolios performance. Investopedia Mira Norian How Indexes Work Indexes are also created to measure other financial or economic data such as interest rates, inflation, or manufacturing output. Indexes often serve as benchmarks against which to evaluate the performance of a portfolios returns. One popular investment strategy, known as indexing , is to try to replicate such an index in a passive manner rather than trying to outperform it. Indexes in finance are typically used to track a statistical measure of change in various security prices. In finance, it typically refers to a statistical measure of change in a securities market. In the case of financial markets, stock and bond market indexes consist of a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a particular market or a segment of it. You cannot invest directly in an index. The SP 500 Index and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index are common benchmarks for the U.S. stock and bond markets, respectively. In reference to mortgages, it refers to a benchmark interest rate created by a third party. Each index related to the stock and bond markets has its own calculation methodology. In most cases, the relative change of an index is more important than the actual numeric value representing the index. For example, if the FTSE 100 Index is at 6,670.40, that number tells investors the index is nearly seven times its base level of 1,000. However, to assess how the index has changed from the previous day, investors must look at the amount the index has fallen, often expressed as a percentage. Index Investing Indexes are also often used as benchmarks against which to measure the performance of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ETFs. For instance, many mutual funds compare their returns to the return in the SP 500 Index to give investors a sense of how much more or less the managers are earning on their money than they would make in an index fund . Indexing is a form of passive fund management. Instead of a fund portfolio manager actively stock picking and market timingthat is, choosing securities to invest in and strategizing when to buy and sell themthe fund manager builds a portfolio wherein the holdings mirror the securities of a particular index. The idea is that by mimicking the profile of the indexthe stock market as a whole, or a broad segment of itthe fund will match its performance as well. Since you cannot invest directly in an index, index funds are created to track their performance. These funds incorporate securities that closely mimic those found in an index, thereby allowing an investor to bet on its performance, for a fee. An example of a popular index fund is the Vanguard SP 500 ETF VOO , which closely mirrors the SP 500 Index. When putting together mutual funds and ETFs, fund sponsors attempt to create portfolios mirroring the components of a certain index. This allows an investor to buy a security likely to rise and fall in tandem with the stock market as a whole or with a segment of the market. Fast Fact The largest exchange-traded fund ETF that tracks the SP 500 is the Vanguard SP 500 ETF VOO, closely followed by the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust SPY. Index Examples The SP 500 Index is one of the worlds best-known market proxy indexes and one of the most commonly used benchmarks for the stock market. It includes 80 of the total stocks traded in the United States. Conversely, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is also well known, but represents stock values from just 30 of the nations publicly traded companies. Other prominent indexes include the Nasdaq 100 Index , Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index , MSCI EAFE Index , and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. Like mutual funds, indexed annuities are tied to a trading index. However, rather than the fund sponsor trying to put together an investment portfolio likely to closely mimic the index in question, these securities feature a rate of return that follows a particular index but typically have caps on the returns they provide. For example, if an investor buys an annuity indexed to the Dow Jones and it has a cap of 10, its rate of return will be between 0 and 10, depending on the annual changes to that index. Indexed annuities allow investors to buy securities that grow along with broad market segments or the total market. Adjustable-rate mortgages feature interest rates that adjust over the life of the loan. The adjustable interest rate is determined by adding a margin to an index. One of the most popular indices on which mortgages are based is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR. For example, if a mortgage indexed to the SOFR has a 2 margin and the SOFR is 3, the interest rate on the loan is 5. What Is an Index Fund? An index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that seeks to replicate the performance of an index, often by constructing its portfolio to mirror that of the index itself. Index investing is considered a passive strategy since it does not involve stock picking or active management. Studies show that over time, indexing strategies tend to perform better than stock-picking strategies. Because they are passive, index funds also tend to have lower fees and tax exposure. What Are Different Ways to Construct an Index? Indexes can be built in a number of ways, often with consideration of how to weight the various components of the index. The three main ways include A market-cap, or capitalization-weighted index , puts more weight in the index to those components that have the largest market capitalization market value, such as the SP 500 A price-weighted index puts more weight on those components with the highest prices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average An equal-weighted index allocates each component with the same weights this is sometimes called an unweighted index Why Are Indexes Useful? Indexes are useful for providing valid benchmarks against which to measure investment performance for a given strategy or portfolio. By understanding how a strategy does relative to a benchmark, one can understand its true performance. Indexes also provide investors with a simplified snapshot of a large market sector, without having to examine every single asset in that index. For example, it would be impractical for an ordinary investor to study hundreds of different stock prices in order to understand the changing fortunes of different technology companies. A sector-specific index can show the average trend for the sector. What Are Some Major Stock Indexes? In the United States, the leading stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the SP 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Russell 2000. For international markets, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 FTSE 100 Index and the Nikkei 225 Index are popular proxies for the British and Japanese stock markets, respectively. Most countries with stock exchanges publish at least one index for their major stocks. What Are Some Bond Indexes? While stock market indexes may most often come to mind, indexes are also constructed around other asset classes. In the bond market, for example, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index tracks the investment-grade bond market, while the Emerging Market Bond Index looks at government bonds of emerging market economies. The Bottom Line Market indexes provide a broad representation of how markets are performing. These indices serve as benchmarks to gauge the movement and performance of market segments. Investors also use indexes as a basis for portfolio or passive index investing. In the U.S., such representative indexes include the large-cap SP 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100.",

    "text": "What Is Inflation? Inflation is a gradual loss of purchasing power that is reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time. The inflation rate is calculated as the average price increase of a basket of selected goods and services over one year. High inflation means that prices are increasing quickly, while low inflation means that prices are growing more slowly. Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when prices decline and purchasing power increases. Key Takeaways Inflation measures how quickly the prices of goods and services are rising. Inflation is classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. The most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index. Inflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint and rate of change. Those with tangible assets may like to see some inflation as it raises the value of their assets. What Is Inflation? Understanding Inflation An increase in the money supply is the root of inflation, though this can play out through different mechanisms in the economy. A countrys money supply can be increased by the monetary authorities by Printing and giving away more money to citizens Legally devaluing reducing the value of the legal tender currency Loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market Other causes of inflation include supply bottlenecks and shortages of key goods, which can push prices to rise. When inflation occurs, money loses its purchasing power. This can occur across any sector or throughout an entire economy. The expectation of inflation itself can further sustain the devaluation of money. Workers may demand higher wages and businesses may charge higher prices, in anticipation of sustained inflation. This, in turn, reinforces the factors that push prices up. Melissa Ling Investopedia, 2019 Types of Inflation Inflation can be classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-Pull Effect Demand-pull inflation occurs when an increase in the supply of money and credit stimulates the overall demand for goods and services to increase more rapidly than the economys production capacity. This increases demand and leads to price rises. When people have more money, it leads to positive consumer sentiment. This, in turn, leads to higher spending, which pulls prices higher. It creates a demand-supply gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices. Cost-Push Effect Cost-push inflation is a result of the increase in prices working through the production process inputs. When additions to the supply of money and credit are channeled into a commodity or other asset markets, costs for all kinds of intermediate goods rise. This is especially evident when theres a negative economic shock to the supply of key commodities. These developments lead to higher costs for the finished product or service and work their way into rising consumer prices. For instance, when the money supply is expanded, it creates a speculative boom in oil prices . This means that the cost of energy can rise and contribute to rising consumer prices, which is reflected in various measures of inflation. Built-In Inflation Built-in inflation is related to adaptive expectations or the idea that people expect current inflation rates to continue in the future. As the price of goods and services rises, people may expect a continuous rise in the future at a similar rate. As such, workers may demand more costs or wages to maintain their standard of living. Their increased wages result in a higher cost of goods and services, and this wage-price spiral continues as one factor induces the other and vice versa. How Inflation Impacts Prices While it is easy to measure the price changes of individual products over time, human needs extend beyond just one or two products. Individuals need a big and diversified set of products as well as a host of services to live a comfortable life. They include commodities like food grains, metal, fuel, utilities like electricity and transportation, and services like healthcare , entertainment, and labor. Inflation aims to measure the overall impact of price changes for a diversified set of products and services. It allows for a single value representation of the increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a specified time. Prices rise, which means that one unit of money buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nations money supply growth outpaces economic growth. 3 The increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPI-U over the 12 months ending January 2025 on an unadjusted basis. Prices increased by 0.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis in January 2025 from the previous month. To combat this, the monetary authority in most cases, the central bank takes the necessary steps to manage the money supply and credit to keep inflation within permissible limits and keep the economy running smoothly. Theoretically, monetarism is a popular theory that explains the relationship between inflation and the money supply of an economy. For example, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, massive amounts of gold and silver flowed into the Spanish and other European economies. Since the money supply rapidly increased, the value of money fell, contributing to rapidly rising prices. Inflation is measured in a variety of ways depending on the types of goods and services. It is the opposite of deflation , which indicates a general decline in prices when the inflation rate falls below 0. Keep in mind that deflation shouldnt be confused with disinflation , which is a related term referring to a slowing down in the positive rate of inflation. Julie Bang Investopedia How to Protect Your Finances During Inflation There are a range of measures that individuals can take to protect their finances against inflation. For instance, one may choose to invest in asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary times. This might include commodities like grain, beef, oil, electricity, and natural gas. Commodity prices typically stay one step ahead of product prices, and price increases for commodities are often seen as an indicator of inflation to come. Commodities, which can also be volatile, are easily affected by natural disasters, geopolitics, or conflict. Real estate income may also help buffer against inflation, as landlords can increase their rent to keep pace with the rise of prices overall. The U.S. government also offers Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a type of security indexed to inflation to protect against declines in purchasing power. Types of Price Indexes Depending upon the selected set of goods and services used, multiple types of baskets of goods are calculated and tracked as price indexes. The most commonly used price indexes are the Consumer Price Index CPI and the Wholesale Price Index WPI . Consumer Price Index CPI The CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of goods and services that are of primary consumer needs. They include transportation, food, and medical care. CPI is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them based on their relative weight in the whole basket. The prices in consideration are the retail prices of each item, as available for purchase by the individual citizens. CPI can impact the value of one currency against those of other nations. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living , making it one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS reports the CPI each month and has calculated it as far back as 1913. Important The CPI-U, which was introduced in 1978, represents the buying habits of approximately 88 of the noninstitutional population of the United States. Wholesale Price Index WPI The WPI is another popular measure of inflation. It measures and tracks the changes in the price of goods in the stages before the retail level. While WPI items vary from one country to another, they mostly include items at the producer or wholesale level. For example, it includes cotton prices for raw cotton, cotton yarn, cotton gray goods, and cotton clothing. Although many countries and organizations use the WPI, many other countries, including the U.S., use a similar variant called the Producer Price Index PPI . Producer Price Index PPI The PPI is a family of indexes that measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers of intermediate goods and services over time. The PPI measures price changes from the perspective of the seller and differs from the CPI, which measures price changes from the perspective of the buyer. In all variants, the rise in the price of one component say oil may cancel out the price decline in another say wheat to a certain extent. Overall, each index represents the average weighted price change for the given constituents which may apply at the overall economy , sector, or commodity level. The Formula for Measuring Inflation The above-mentioned variants of price indexes can be used to calculate the value of inflation between two particular months or years. While a lot of ready-made inflation calculators are already available on various financial portals and websites, it is always better to be aware of the underlying methodology to ensure accuracy with a clear understanding of the calculations. Mathematically, Percent Inflation Rate Final CPI Index Value Initial CPI Value 100 Say you wish to know how the purchasing power of 10,000 changed between January 1975 and January 2024. One can find price index data on various portals in a tabular form. From that table, pick up the corresponding CPI figures for the given two months. For September 1975, it was 52.1 initial CPI value, and for January 2024, it was 308.417 final CPI value. Plugging in the formula yields Percent Inflation Rate 308.417 52.1 100 5.9197 100 591.97 Since you wish to know how much 10,000 from January 1975 would be worth in January 2024, multiply the inflation rate by the amount to get the changed dollar value Change in Dollar Value 5.9197 10,000 59,197 This means that 10,000 in January 1975 will be worth 59,197 today. Essentially, if you purchased a basket of goods and services as included in the CPI definition worth 10,000 in 1975, the same basket would cost you 59,197 in January 2024. Advantages and Disadvantages of Inflation Inflation can be construed as either a good or a bad thing, depending upon which side one takes, and how rapidly the change occurs. Advantages Individuals with tangible assets like property or stocked commodities priced in their home currency may like to see some inflation as that raises the price of their assets, which they can sell at a higher rate. Inflation often leads to speculation by businesses in risky projects and by individuals who invest in company stocks because they expect better returns than inflation. An optimum level of inflation is often promoted to encourage spending to a certain extent instead of saving. If the purchasing power of money falls over time, there may be a greater incentive to spend now instead of saving and spending later. It may increase spending, which may boost economic activities in a country. A balanced approach is thought to keep the inflation value in an optimum and desirable range. Disadvantages Buyers of such assets may not be happy with inflation, as they will be required to shell out more money. People who hold assets valued in their home currency, such as cash or bonds, may not like inflation, as it erodes the real value of their holdings. As such, investors looking to protect their portfolios from inflation should consider inflation-hedged asset classes, such as gold, commodities, and real estate investment trusts REITs. Inflation-indexed bonds are another popular option for investors to profit from inflation . High and variable rates of inflation can impose major costs on an economy. Businesses, workers, and consumers must all account for the effects of generally rising prices in their buying, selling, and planning decisions. This introduces an additional source of uncertainty into the economy, because they may guess wrong about the rate of future inflation. Time and resources expended on researching, estimating, and adjusting economic behavior are expected to rise to the general level of prices. Thats opposed to real economic fundamentals, which inevitably represent a cost to the economy as a whole. Even a low, stable, and easily predictable rate of inflation, which some consider otherwise optimal, may lead to serious problems in the economy. Thats because of how, where, and when the new money enters the economy. Whenever new money and credit enter the economy, it is always in the hands of specific individuals or business firms. The process of price level adjustments to the new money supply proceeds as they then spend the new money and it circulates from hand to hand and account to account through the economy. Inflation does drive up some prices first and drives up other prices later. This sequential change in purchasing power and prices known as the Cantillon effect means that the process of inflation not only increases the general price level over time but also distorts relative prices , wages, and rates of return along the way. Economists, in general, understand that distortions of relative prices away from their economic equilibrium are not good for the economy, and Austrian economists even believe this process to be a major driver of cycles of recession in the economy. Pros Leads to higher resale value of assets Optimum levels of inflation encourage spending Cons Buyers have to pay more for products and services Imposes higher prices on the economy Drives some prices up first and others later How Inflation Can Be Controlled A countrys financial regulator shoulders the important responsibility of keeping inflation in check. It is done by implementing measures through monetary policy , which refers to the actions of a central bank or other committees that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply. In the U.S., the Feds monetary policy goals include moderate long-term interest rates, price stability, and maximum employment. Each of these goals is intended to promote a stable financial environment. The Federal Reserve clearly communicates long-term inflation goals in order to keep a steady long-term rate of inflation , which is thought to be beneficial to the economy. Price stability or a relatively constant level of inflation allows businesses to plan for the future since they know what to expect. The Fed believes that this will promote maximum employment, which is determined by non-monetary factors that fluctuate over time and are therefore subject to change. For this reason, the Fed doesnt set a specific goal for maximum employment, and it is largely determined by employers assessments. Maximum employment does not mean zero unemployment, as at any given time there is a certain level of volatility as people vacate and start new jobs. Hyperinflation is often described as a period of inflation of 50 or more per month. Monetary authorities also take exceptional measures in extreme conditions of the economy. For instance, following the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Fed kept the interest rates near zero and pursued a bond-buying program called quantitative easing QE . Some critics of the program alleged it would cause a spike in inflation in the U.S. dollar, but inflation peaked in 2007 and declined steadily over the next eight years. There are many complex reasons why QE didnt lead to inflation or hyperinflation , though the simplest explanation is that the recession itself was a very prominent deflationary environment, and quantitative easing supported its effects. Consequently, U.S. policymakers have attempted to keep inflation steady at around 2 per year. The European Central Bank ECB has also pursued aggressive quantitative easing to counter deflation in the eurozone, and some places have experienced negative interest rates . Thats due to fears that deflation could take hold in the eurozone and lead to economic stagnation. Moreover, countries that experience higher rates of growth can absorb higher rates of inflation. Indias target is around 4 with an upper tolerance of 6 and a lower tolerance of 2, while Brazil aims for 3.25 with an upper tolerance of 4.75 and a lower tolerance of 1.75. Meaning of Inflation, Deflation, and Disinflation While a high inflation rate means that prices are increasing, a low inflation rate does not mean that prices are falling. Counterintuitively, when the inflation rate falls, prices are still increasing, but at a slower rate than before. When the inflation rate falls but remains positive, this is known as disinflation . Conversely, if the inflation rate becomes negative, that means that prices are falling. This is known as deflation , which can have negative effects on an economy. Because buying power increases over time, consumers have less incentive to spend money in the short term, resulting in falling economic activity. Hedging Against Inflation Stocks are considered to be the best hedge against inflation , as the rise in stock prices is inclusive of the effects of inflation. Since additions to the money supply in virtually all modern economies occur as bank credit injections through the financial system, much of the immediate effect on prices happens in financial assets that are priced in their home currency, such as stocks. Special financial instruments exist that one can use to safeguard investments against inflation. They include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a low-risk treasury security that is indexed to inflation where the principal amount invested is increased by the percentage of inflation. One can also opt for a TIPS mutual fund or TIPS-based exchange-traded fund ETF . To get access to stocks, ETFs, and other funds that can help avoid the dangers of inflation, youll likely need a brokerage account. Choosing a stockbroker can be a tedious process due to the variety among them. Gold is also considered to be a hedge against inflation, although this doesnt always appear to be the case looking backward. Examples of Inflation Since all world currencies are fiat money , the money supply could increase rapidly for political reasons, resulting in rapid price level increases. The most famous example is the hyperinflation that struck the German Weimar Republic in the early 1920s. The nations that were victorious in World War I demanded reparations from Germany, which could not be paid in German paper currency, as this was of suspect value due to government borrowing. Germany attempted to print paper notes, buy foreign currency with them, and use that to pay their debts. This policy led to the rapid devaluation of the German mark along with the hyperinflation that accompanied the development. German consumers responded to the cycle by trying to spend their money as fast as possible, understanding that it would be worth less and less the longer they waited. More money flooded the economy, and its value plummeted to the point where people would paper their walls with practically worthless bills. Similar situations occurred in Peru in 1990 and in Zimbabwe between 2007 and 2008. What Causes Inflation? There are three main causes of inflation demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-pull inflation refers to situations where there are not enough products or services being produced to keep up with demand, causing their prices to increase. Cost-push inflation, on the other hand, occurs when the cost of producing products and services rises, forcing businesses to raise their prices. Built-in inflation which is sometimes referred to as a wage-price spiral occurs when workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs. This, in turn, causes businesses to raise their prices in order to offset their rising wage costs, leading to a self-reinforcing loop of wage and price increases. Is Inflation Good or Bad? Too much inflation is generally considered bad for an economy, while too little inflation is also considered harmful. Many economists advocate for a middle ground of low to moderate inflation, of around 2 per year. Generally speaking, higher inflation harms savers because it erodes the purchasing power of the money they have saved however, it can benefit borrowers because the inflation-adjusted value of their outstanding debts shrinks over time. What Are the Effects of Inflation? Inflation can affect the economy in several ways. For example, if inflation causes a nations currency to decline, this can benefit exporters by making their goods more affordable when priced in the currency of foreign nations. On the other hand, this could harm importers by making foreign-made goods more expensive. Higher inflation can also encourage spending, as consumers will aim to purchase goods quickly before their prices rise further. Savers, on the other hand, could see the real value of their savings erode, limiting their ability to spend or invest in the future. Why Was Inflation So High in 2024? Inflation has remained elevated since 2022 when inflation rates around the world rose to their highest levels since the early 1980s. While there is no single reason for this rapid rise in global prices, a series of events worked together to boost inflation to such high levels. The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and other restrictions that greatly disrupted global supply chains, from factory closures to bottlenecks at maritime ports. Governments also issued stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits to counter the financial impact on individuals and small businesses. When vaccines became widespread and the economy bounced back, demand fueled in part by stimulus money and low interest rates quickly outpaced supply, which struggled to get back to pre-COVID levels. Russias unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Russia, limiting the worlds supply of oil and gas since Russia is a large producer of fossil fuels. Food prices also rose as Ukraines large grain harvests could not be exported. As fuel and food prices rose, it led to similar increases down the value chains. The Fed raised interest rates to combat the high inflation, which significantly came down in 2023, though it remains above pre-pandemic levels . The Bottom Line Inflation is a rise in prices, which results in the decline of purchasing power over time. Inflation is natural and the U.S. government targets an annual inflation rate of 2 however, inflation can be dangerous when it increases too much, too fast. Inflation makes items more expensive, especially if wages do not rise by the same levels of inflation. Additionally, inflation erodes the value of some assets, especially cash. Governments and central banks seek to control inflation through monetary policy.",

    "text": "Definition An interest rate is the price an entity pays for borrowing money or the fee they charge for lending it, expressed as a percentage. What Is an Interest Rate? The interest rate is the percentage of interest relative to the principal . It is either what lenders charge borrowers or what is earned from deposit accounts. The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis and is expressed as an annual percentage rate APR. An interest rate can also apply to a savings account or a certificate of deposit CD. In this case, a bank or credit union pays a percentage of the funds deposited to the account holder. Annual percentage yield APY refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts. Key Takeaways An interest rate also applies to the amount earned at a bank or credit union from a deposit account. Most mortgages use simple interest. However, some loans use compound interest, which is applied to the principal but also to the accumulated interest of previous periods. A loan that is considered low-risk by the lender will have a lower interest rate. A loan that is considered high-risk will have a higher interest rate. The APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. Savings accounts and CDs use compound interest. Investopedia Julie Bang Understanding Interest Rates In lending, interest is a charge to the borrower for the use of an asset. Assets borrowed can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and property. Because of this, an interest rate can be thought of as the cost of money. Higher interest rates make borrowing the same amount of money more expensive. Interest rates apply to most lending or borrowing transactions. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes, fund projects, launch or fund businesses, or pay for college tuition. Businesses take out loans to fund capital projects and expand their operations by purchasing fixed and long-term assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. Borrowed money is repaid either in a lump sum by a pre-determined date or in periodic installments. For loans, the interest rate is applied to the principal, which is the amount of the loan. The interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The money to be repaid is usually more than the borrowed amount since lenders require compensation for the loss of use of the money during the loan period. The lender could have invested the funds during that period instead of providing a loan, which would have generated income from the asset. The difference between the total repayment sum and the original loan is the interest charged. When the loan is considered to be low risk by the lender, the borrower will usually be charged a lower interest rate. If the loan is considered high risk, the interest rate that the borrower is charged will be higher. Important Risk is typically assessed when a lender looks at a potential borrowers credit score, which is why its important to have an excellent one if you want to qualify for the best loans. Simple Interest Rate If you take out a 300,000 loan from the bank and the loan agreement stipulates that the interest rate on the loan is 4 simple interest, this means that you will have to pay the bank the original loan amount of 300,000 4 x 300,000 300,000 12,000 312,000. The example above was calculated based on the annual simple interest formula, which is Simple interest principal x interest rate x time The individual who took out the loan will have to pay 12,000 in interest at the end of the year, assuming it was only a one-year lending agreement. If the loan was a 30-year mortgage, the interest payment will be Simple interest 300,000 x 4 x 30 360,000 A simple interest rate of 4 annually translates into an annual interest payment of 12,000. After 30 years, the borrower would have made 12,000 x 30 years 360,000 in interest payments. Compound Interest Rate Some lenders prefer the compound interest method, which means that the borrower pays even more in interest. Compound interest, also called interest on interest , is applied both to the principal and also to the accumulated interest made during previous periods. The bank assumes that at the end of the first year the borrower owes the principal plus interest for that year. The bank also assumes that at the end of the second year, the borrower owes the principal plus the interest for the first year plus the interest on interest for the first year. The interest owed when compounding is higher than the interest owed using the simple interest method. The interest is charged monthly on the principal, including accrued interest from the previous months. For shorter time frames, the calculation of interest will be similar for both methods. As the lending time increases, however, the disparity between the two types of interest calculations grows. Using the example above, at the end of 30 years, the total owed in interest is almost 673,019 on a 300,000 loan with a 4 interest rate. The following formula can be used to calculate compound interest Compound interest p x 1 interest rate n 1 where p principal n number of compounding periods Lets look at another example. Jayati takes out a three-year loan of 10,000 at an interest rate of 5, which compounds annually. In the end, as worked out in the calculation below, she pays 1,576.25 in interest on the loan 10,000 1 0.05 3 1 10,000 1.157625 1 1,576.25 Compound Interest and Savings Accounts When you save money using a savings account, compound interest is favorable. The interest earned on these accounts is compounded and serves as compensation to the account holder for allowing the bank to use the deposited funds. If, for example, you deposit 500,000 into a high-yield savings account , the bank can take 300,000 of these funds to use as a mortgage loan. To compensate you, the bank pays 5 interest into the account annually. So, while the bank is taking 8 from the borrower, it is giving 5 to you, the account holder, netting it 3 in interest. In effect, savers lend the bank money which, in turn, provides funds to borrowers in return for interest. APR vs. APY Interest rates on consumer loans are typically quoted as the annual percentage rate APR . This is the rate of return that lenders demand for the ability to borrow their money. For example, the interest rate on credit cards is quoted as an APR. In our example above, 4 is the APR for the mortgage . The APR does not consider compounded interest for the year. The annual percentage yield APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. This interest rate takes compounding into account. How Are Interest Rates Determined? The interest rate charged by banks is determined by a number of factors, including the state of the economy. A countrys central bank e.g., the Federal Reserve in the U.S. sets the interest rate, which each bank uses to determine the APR range they offer. When the central bank sets interest rates at a high level, the cost of debt rises. When the cost of debt is high, it discourages people from borrowing and slows consumer demand. Interest rates tend to rise with inflation . In a high-interest-rate economy, businesses have limited access to capital funding through debt, which can lead to economic contraction. Economies are often stimulated during periods of low interest rates because borrowers have access to loans at inexpensive rates. Since interest rates on savings are low, businesses and individuals are more likely to spend and purchase riskier investment vehicles such as stocks. This spending fuels the economy and provides an injection to capital markets leading to economic expansion. While governments prefer lower interest rates, they eventually lead to market disequilibrium where demand exceeds supply, causing inflation. When inflation occurs, interest rates increase, which may relate to Walras law . 6.85 The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in February 2025. This was slightly down from 6.90 a year earlier. Interest Rates and Race There is evidence that suggests that white people get approved more often for mortgages. Data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the most comprehensive publicly-available information on mortgage market activity, showed that Black, Hispanic, and Asian applicants were denied conventional mortgage loans in 2023 17.1, 12.1, and 9.7 of the time, respectively. The denial rate for white applicants, on the other hand, was lower at 6.8. Evidence of interest rate discrimination with mortgages has been confirmed by other sources, including Harvard University and the Urban Institute, which found in 2022 that the average Black homeowner gets charged an interest rate that is 33 basis points higher than the average white homeowner, and pays about 250 more per year in interest. Not everybody agrees with these findings. A study by economists at the Federal Reserve Board concluded that no racial group gets preferential treatment, leading its authors to speculate that reporting of disparities elsewhere may be due to many Black and Hispanic borrowers tending to choose slightly higher interest rates in return for lower up-front costs. The Federal Reserve Board believes discrimination is improving and credits this, in part, to a rise in automated underwriting and stricter enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Why Are Interest Rates on 30-year Loans Higher than on 15-year Loans? Interest rates are a function of the risk of default and the opportunity cost . Longer loans and debts are inherently more risky, as there is more time for the borrower to default. The same time, the opportunity cost is also larger over longer time periods, as the principal is tied up and cannot be used for any other purpose. How Does the Fed Use Interest Rates? The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, uses interest rates as a monetary policy tool. By increasing the cost of borrowing among commercial banks, the central bank can influence many other interest rates, such as those for personal loans, business loans, and mortgages. This makes borrowing more expensive in general, lowering the demand for money and cooling off a hot economy. Lowering interest rates, on the other hand, makes money easier to borrow, stimulating spending and investment. Why Do Bond Prices React Inversely to Interest Rate Changes? A bond is a debt instrument that typically pays a fixed rate of interest over its lifetime. Say that prevailing interest rates are 5. If a bond is priced at par 1,000 and has an interest rate coupon of 5, it will pay bondholders 50 a year. If interest rates rise to 10, new bonds issued will pay doublei.e., 100 per 1,000 in face value . An existing bond that only pays 50 will have to sell at a steep discount in order for somebody to want to buy it. Likewise, if interest rates drop to 1, new bonds will only pay 10 per 1,000 in face value. Hence, a bond that pays 50 will be in high demand and its price will be bid up quite high. The Bottom Line An interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. When you take out a loan, you are expected to pay the entity lending you money something extra as compensation. Likewise, if you deposit money in a savings account, the financial institution may reward you because it can use part of this money to make more loans to its customers. These charges or payments are called interest and are applied at a specified rate.",

    "text": "Definition A stock, also called an equity or a share, is an ownership stake in the corporation that issued it. What Are Stocks? A stock is a security that represents ownership of a fraction of the corporation that issued it. Units of stock are called shares and entitle the owner to a portion of the corporations profits equal to the number of shares owned. Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on public exchanges. The exchanges and the stocks that are listed on them are required to conform to government regulations meant to protect investors from fraudulent practices. Key Takeaways A stock is proof of ownership of a fractional percentage of the company that issued it. Corporations issue stock to raise money to operate or expand their businesses. There are two main types of stock common and preferred. Historically, stocks outperform most other investments over the long run. Understanding Stocks Corporations issue stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. The holder of stock, a shareholder, may have a claim to part of the companys assets and earnings. A shareholder is considered an owner of the issuing company, determined by the number of shares an investor owns relative to the number of outstanding shares . If a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares, that person would own and have a claim to 10 of the companys assets and earnings . Stockholders do not own a corporation, but corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons. Corporations file taxes, can borrow, can own property, and can be sued. The idea that a corporation is a person means that the corporation owns its assets . A corporate office full of chairs and tables belongs to the corporation, and not to the shareholders. Corporate property is legally separated from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability of both the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets sold, but a shareholders assets are not at risk. The court cannot force you to sell your shares, although the value of your shares may have fallen. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, they cannot sell the companys assets to pay their creditors . Shareholder A person, company, or institution that owns at least one share of a companys stock What Is Shareholder Ownership? What shareholders own are shares issued by the corporation, and the corporation owns the assets held by a firm. If you own 33 of the shares of a company, it is incorrect to assert that you own one-third of that company. However, you do own one-third of the companys shares. This is known as separation of ownership and control. Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive dividends if and when they are distributed, and the right to sell your shares to somebody else. If you own a majority of shares, your voting power increases so that you can indirectly control the direction of a company by appointing its board of directors. This becomes most apparent when one company buys another. The acquiring company buys all the outstanding shares. The board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the corporation and often does so by hiring professional managers, or officers, such as the chief executive officer CEO . Ordinary shareholders do not manage the company. The importance of being a shareholder is that you are entitled to a portion of the companys profits, which is the foundation of a stocks value. The more shares you own, the larger the portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, however, do not pay out dividends and instead reinvest profits back into growing the company. These retained earnings , however, are still reflected in the value of a stock. Tip Read about Investopedias 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special-issue print edition. How to Compare Common and Preferred Stock There are two main types of stock common and preferred . Common stock usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders meetings and to receive any dividends paid out by the corporation. Preferred stockholders generally do not have voting rights , though they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stockholders. For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before common shareholders and have priority if a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated. Fast Fact The first common stock ever issued was by the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Companies can issue new shares whenever there is a need to raise additional cash. This process dilutes the ownership and rights of existing shareholders provided that they do not buy any of the new offerings. Corporations can also engage in stock buybacks, which benefit existing shareholders because they cause their shares to appreciate in value. What Is the Difference Between Stocks and Bonds? Stocks are issued by companies to raise capital to grow the business or undertake new projects. There are important distinctions between whether somebody buys shares directly from the company when it issues them in the primary market or from another shareholder in the secondary market . When the corporation issues shares, it does so in return for money. Bonds vary from stocks in several ways. Bondholders are creditors to the corporation and are entitled to interest as well as repayment of the principal invested. Also, creditors are given legal priority over other stakeholders in the event of a bankruptcy and will be made whole first if a company is forced to sell assets . Conversely, shareholders often receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy, implying that stocks are inherently riskier investments than bonds. How Do You Buy Stock? Most often, stocks are bought and sold on stock exchanges , such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange NYSE. After a company goes public through an initial public offering IPO, its stock becomes available for investors to buy and sell on an exchange. Typically, investors will use a brokerage account to purchase stock on the exchange, which will list the purchasing price the bid or the selling price the offer. The price of the stock is influenced by supply and demand factors in the market, among other variables. How Can You Earn Income from Owning Stock? There are two ways to earn money by owning shares of stock through dividends and capital appreciation. Dividends are cash distributions of company profits. If a company has 1,000 shares outstanding and declares a 5,000 dividend, then stockholders will get 5 for each share they own. Capital appreciation is the increase in the share price itself. If you sell a share to someone for 10, and the stock is later worth 11, the shareholder has made 1. Is It Risky to Own Stock? All investments have a degree of risk . Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds ETFs can lose value if market conditions decline. When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions or corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company. Historically, stocks have outperformed most other investments over the long run. The Bottom Line A stock represents fractional ownership of equity in an organization. It is different from a bond, which operates like a loan made by creditors to the company in return for periodic payments. A company issues stock to raise capital from investors for new projects or to expand its business operations. The type of stock , common or preferred, held by a shareholder determines the rights and benefits of ownership.",

    "text": "Definition A bond is a fixed-income instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower thats typically a corporate or government entity. What Is a Bond? A bond is a fixed-income instrument and investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a certain interest rate for an amount of time. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower. Key Takeaways A bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate or coupon to debtholders. Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice-versa. Bonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default. Investopedia Ellen Lindner How Bonds Work Bonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure. Corporations often borrow to grow their business , buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees. Bonds are fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be paid back. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate . The initial price of most bonds is typically set at par or 1,000 face value per individual bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures. Fast Fact Markets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individualslong after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date . Characteristics of Bonds Face value or Par Value The value of the bond at maturity and the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments. Coupon Rate The rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage. Coupon Dates The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Maturity Date The date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond. Issue Price The price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In many cases, bonds are issued at par . Bond Categories There are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms. Corporate Bonds Companies issue corporate bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates. Municipal Bonds Issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors. Government Bonds Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called Bills, bonds issued with one10 years to maturity are called notes, and government bonds issued with more than 10 years to maturity are called bonds. The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as treasuries . Agency Bonds Issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are considered agency bonds . Bond Prices and Interest Rates A bonds price changes daily where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bonds price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa. The issuer of a fixed-rate bond promises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a 1,000 par, 10 annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder 100 each year. If prevailing market interest rates are also 10 at the time that this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return 100. However, if interest rates drop to 5, the investor can only receive 50 from the government bond but would still receive 100 from the corporate bond. Investors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environmentin this case, the bond will trade at 2,000 so that the 100 coupon represents 5. Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15, then an investor could make 150 from the government bond and would not pay 1,000 to earn just 100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case to a price of 666.67. Yield-to-Maturity YTM The yield-to-maturity YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate. YTM is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled. YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate. YTM. Investopedia Investors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1 change in interest rates. This practical definition is the modified duration of a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes. How To Invest in Bonds While there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and TIPS are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via its TreasuryDirect website. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds . Investors can also take a look at Investopedias list of the best online stock brokers . Image by Sabrina Jiang Â Investopedia 2020 Bond Variations The bonds available for investors come in many different varieties, depending on the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes. Zero-Coupon Bonds Z-bonds Do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. U.S. Treasury bills are zero-coupon bonds . Convertible Bonds Debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock equity at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price. Callable Bonds Have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond can be called back by the company before it matures. A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value. Puttable Bonds allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured. This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders. What Determines a Bonds Coupon Rate? Two features of a bondcredit quality and time to maturityare the principal determinants of a bonds coupon rate. If the issuer has a poor credit rating , the risk of default is greater, and these bonds pay more interest. Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed to interest rate and inflation risks for an extended period. How Are Bonds Rated? Credit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies like Standard and Poors , Moodys , and Fitch Ratings . The very highest quality bonds are called investment grade and include debt issued by the U.S. government and very stable companies, such as many utilities. Bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called high yield or junk bonds. These bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk. What Is Duration? Bonds and bond portfolios will rise or fall in value as interest rates change. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called duration . The use of the term duration in this context can be confusing to new bond investors because it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. Instead, duration describes how much a bonds price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates. The Bottom Line Bonds are issued by companies and governments to finance projects and fund operations. A bond is considered a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate to debtholders. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers or buy government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website.",

    "text": "Definition A mutual fund is a financial vehicle that pools money from shareholders to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. A mutual fund pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. For millions of Americans, these funds are the cornerstone of their retirement savings, offering professional management and built-in diversification that would be difficult to achieve on their own. In a mutual fund, investors pool their money to buy assets together, benefiting from shared costs and professional expertise. Rather than buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy shares in the fund itself, becoming partial owners of all its holdings. When you invest in a mutual fund, youre essentially hiring professional money managers to make investment decisions on your behalf. These managers research opportunities, select securities, and monitor performance according to the funds stated objectiveswhether thats aggressive growth, steady income, or matching a market index. Key Takeaways Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to build diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds and other securities managed by finance professionals. Fund shares are priced once daily at market close based on the net asset value NAV of all holdings minus expenses divided by total shares. Investors can earn returns through capital gains when fund holdings increase in value, dividend and interest distributions, or selling shares for a profit. Key benefits include professional management, diversification, and relatively low investment minimums, though fees and expenses can impact returns. Most Americans invest in mutual funds through employer retirement plans like 401ks, with over half of U.S. households owning fund shares. Investopedia Ellen Lindner Mutual Funds How Many is Too Many? How Mutual Funds Work Mutual funds are portfolios of investments funded by all those who have bought shares in the fund. When someone buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all the funds underlying assets. The funds performance depends on its assetsif its full of stocks going up, it will go up. If theyre going down, so, too, will the fund. While a mutual fund manager oversees the portfolio, deciding how to divide money across sectors, industries, companies, etc., based on the funds strategy, many mutual funds are so-called index or passive funds , with portfolios that shouldnt need too much management. They simply mirror the assets of indexes like the SP 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The biggest fund managers are Vanguard and Fidelity . Tip The reason mutual funds are so often the default for retirement accounts like 401ks is that they let you instantly diversify across hundreds of securities with a relatively modest amount of money. The number of American households invested in mutual funds has increased significantly since they were introduced about half a century ago, from about 6 of households in 1980 to about 53 in the mid-2020s, including about 35 of Gen Z households. Together, American households own about 88 of all mutual fund assets. Mutual funds give everyday investors access to a diverse investment menu they likely couldnt build on their own. Rather than putting all your money into one stock or bondwhich can be riskya mutual fund spreads your investments across many different securities. How To Invest in Mutual Funds Investing in mutual funds is relatively straightforward, involving the following steps Before buying shares, you should check with your employer to see if they offer mutual funds through your 401k or other retirement funds since these might have matching fundsessentially doubling what you put in. Once you know you wont be investing in mutual funds through work, make sure you have a brokerage account with enough deposited to buy the mutual fund shares you want. Identify mutual funds that match your investing goals regarding risk, returns, fees, and minimum investments. Many platforms offer fund screening tools. Determine how much you want to invest and submit your trade. To increase your investment over time, you can often set up automatic periodic purchases of shares. While these investments are often long-term, you should periodically check the funds performance and adjust as needed. When its time to close your position, enter a sell order on your platform. Types of Mutual Funds There are many types among the more than 8,800 mutual funds in the U.S., with most in four main categories stock, money market, bond, and target-date funds. Target Date Funds The Set-It-and-Forget-It Approach Target date funds offer a straightforward approach to retirement investing by automatically adjusting their mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on when you plan to retire. These mutual funds, which often have years like 2045 or 2050 in their names, start with aggressive growth strategies and gradually become more conservative as you approach retirement. These funds require active managementbut not from you. Earlier in your career, the fund might invest 90 of your money in stocks for growth potential. As you near retirement, it shifts more money into bonds and cash to help protect your nest egg from market swings. For example, a 30-year-old planning to retire in 2065 might choose a 2065 Target Date Fund. Initially, this fund would primarily hold stocks. Over time, it automatically rebalances to include more conservative investments, cutting down on risk when you can least afford major losses. However, target date funds arent one-size-fits-all. Their fees can vary significantly, and their investment strategiesknown as glide pathsdiffer among fund companies. Some funds maintain significant stock exposure even after retirement, while others take a more conservative approach. Important More than 90 of employee retirement plans in the U.S. use target date funds as their default. Stock Funds This type of fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are assorted subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in firms with small-, mid-, or large-sized capitalization . Others are named by their investment approach aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in U.S. stocks or foreign equities. To understand how these strategies and sizes of assets can combine, you can use an equity-style box like the example below. Value funds invest in stocks their managers see as undervalued while aiming at long-term appreciation when the market recognizes the stocks true worth. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings PE ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and dividend yields. Meanwhile, growth funds look to companies with solid earnings, sales, and cash flow growth. These companies typically have high price-to-earnings ratios and do not pay much in dividends. A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a blend. These funds invest in a mix of growth and value stocks to give a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in the middle. InvestopediaJulie Bang Large-cap companies have market capitalizations of over 10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically for blue-chip firms whose names are recognizable. Small-cap stocks have a market cap between 250 million and 2 billion. These companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Mid-cap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap. A mutual fund may combine different investment styles and company sizes. For example, a large-cap value fund might include in its portfolio large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall these would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box large and value. The opposite of this would be a small-cap growth fund that invests in startup technology companies with high growth prospects. This kind of fund is in the bottom right quadrant above small and growth. Bond Funds A mutual fund that generates a consistent and minimum return is part of the fixed-income category. These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments . The bonds should generate interest income thats passed on to the shareholders, with limited investment risk. There are also actively managed funds that look for relatively undervalued bonds to sell them at a profit. These mutual funds will likely pay higher returns but arent without risk. For example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities. Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where and when they invest, and all bond funds have interest rate risk . Tip Most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies or fund families such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer. Index Funds Index mutual funds are designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the SP 500. This passive strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so fewer expenses are passed on to investors through fees, and these funds are designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind. They also frequently outperform actively managed mutual funds and thus potentially are the rare combination in life of lower costs and better performance. Balanced Funds Balanced funds invest across different securities, whether stocks, bonds, the money market , or alternative investments. The objective of these funds, known as an asset-allocation fund, is to cut risk through diversification. Money Market Funds The money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. The returns on them arent substantial. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the average certificate of deposit CD . Money market mutual funds are often used as a temporary holding place for cash that will be used for future investments or for an emergency fund. While low risk, they arent insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC like savings accounts or CDs. Income Funds Income funds are meant to disburse income on a steady basis, and are often seen as the mutual funds for retirement investing. They invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. While fund holdings may rise in value, the primary goal is to offer a steady cash flow. International Funds An international mutual fund , or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investors home country. Global funds, however, can invest anywhere worldwide. Their volatility depends on where and when the funds are invested. Sector and Theme Funds Sector mutual funds aim to profit from the performance of specific industries, such as finance, technology, or healthcare. Theme funds can cut across sectors. For example, a fund focused on AI might have holdings in firms in healthcare, defense, and other areas employing and building out AI beyond the tech industry. Socially Responsible Mutual Funds Socially responsible investing invest only in companies and sectors that meet preset criteria. For example, some socially responsible funds do not invest in industries like tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power. Sustainable mutual funds invest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling. There are also funds that review environmental, social, and governance factors when choosing investments. This approach focuses on the companys management practices and whether they tend toward environmental and community improvement. Top Mutual Funds Below are five large mutual funds that represent a range of the types of funds listed above Vanguard 500 Index Fund VFIAX The oldest such mutual fund, VFIAX tracks the SP 500 Index , making it a way to invest in 500 of Americas largest companies with a single purchase. With a very low 0.04 expense ratio meaning you pay 40 cents annually per 1,000 invested, it requires a 3,000 minimum investment. Since its launch half a century ago, the fund has returned an average of about 8.27 annually. Fidelity 500 Index Fund FXAIX Like Vanguards offering, it charges even less, just 0.015 in annual expenses 15 cents per 1,000 invested and has no minimum investment requirement. The fund invests in technology, financial, healthcare and consumer companies, closely matching the SP 500 index while maintaining flexibility to invest up to 20 outside the index. T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund PRDGX This actively managed fund focuses on companies that consistently pay and increase their regular cash payments to shareholders. While its 0.64 expense ratio is higher than index funds, the strategy targets stable, financially healthy companies. The minimum investment is 2,500. Fidelity ZERO International Index Fund FZILX For investors seeking global diversification, this fund offers exposure to non-U.S. companies with no fees, a 0 expense ratio. The fund focuses on established international companies to help manage risk while providing worldwide investment exposure. Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund VBTLX This fund provides broad exposure to U.S. bonds, primarily government, and high-quality corporate debt. With a 0.05 expense ratio and a 3,000 minimum investment, its designed to provide steady income and help balance out the stock markets risks. Tip While many mutual funds are no-load, you can frequently avoid brokerage fees and commissions anyway by purchasing a fund directly from the mutual fund company instead of going through an intermediary. How Mutual Fund Shares Are Priced The value of the mutual fund depends on the performance of the securities it invests in. When buying a unit or share of a mutual fund, you get a part of its portfolio value. Investing in a share of a mutual fund differs from investing in stock shares. Unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give their holders voting rights. And unlike exchange-traded funds ETFs, you cant trade your shares throughout the trading day. Mutual fund share prices come from the net asset value NAV per share, sometimes listed as NAVPS . A funds NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the number of shares outstanding. Mutual fund shares are typically bought or redeemed at the funds NAV, which doesnt fluctuate during market hours but is settled at the end of each trading day. The price of a mutual fund is also updated when the NAVPS is settled. How Are Earnings Calculated for Mutual Funds? Investors typically earn returns from a mutual fund in three ways Dividendinterest income Mutual funds distribute the dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in its portfolio. Funds often give investors the choice of either receiving a deposit for distributions or reinvesting earnings for more shares in the mutual fund. Portfolio distributions If the fund sells securities that have increased in price, the fund realizes a capital gain , which most funds also pass on to investors in a distribution. Capital gains distribution When the funds shares increase in price, you can sell your mutual fund shares for a profit in the market. When researching the returns of a mutual fund, youll typically come upon a figure for the total return, or the net change in value either up or down over a specific period. This includes any interest, dividends, or capital gains the fund has generated along with the change in its market value during a given period. In most cases, total returns are given for one, five, and 10-year periods, as well as from the day the fund opened. Pros and Cons of Investing in Mutual Funds There are many reasons that mutual funds have been the retail investors vehicle of choice , with an overwhelming majority of money in employer-sponsored retirement plans invested in mutual funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular, has long paid very close attention to how these funds are run, given their importance to so many Americans and their retirements. Mutual Fund Pros Cons Pros Ability to buy and sell shares relatively quickly Diversification Minimal investment requirements Professional management Variety of offerings Cons Fees, commissions, and other expenses Large cash presence in portfolios No FDIC coverage Difficulty in comparing funds Lack of transparency in holdings Pros of Mutual Fund Investing Diversification A diversified portfolio has securities with different capitalizations and industries and bonds with varying maturities and issuers. A mutual fund can achieve diversification faster and more cheaply than buying individual securities. Ease of Access Trading on the major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. Also, for certain types of assets, like foreign equities or exotic commodities , mutual funds are often the most workablesometimes the onlyway for individual investors to participate. Economies of Scale Because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs are lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions. A mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could. Professional Management A mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. Mutual funds require much lower investment minimums, providing a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management. Transparency Mutual funds are subject to industry regulations meant to ensure accountability and fairness for investors. In addition, the component securities of each mutual fund can be found across many platforms. Tip Mutual fund managers are legally obligated to follow the funds stated mandate and to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders. Cons of Mutual Fund Investing Liquidity , diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options. However, there are drawbacks No FDIC Guarantee Like many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund will depreciate . Equity mutual funds experience price fluctuations, along with the stocks in the funds portfolio. The FDIC does not guarantee mutual fund investments. Cash Drag To maintain liquidity and the ability to accommodate withdrawals, mutual funds typically have to keep a larger percentage of their portfolio as cash than other investors. Because this cash earns no return, its called a cash drag. Higher Costs Fees that reduce your overall payout from a mutual fund are assessed whatever the performance of the fund. Failing to pay attention to the fees can cost you since actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate and compound year over year. Dilution Dilution is also the result of a successful fund growing too big. When new money pours into funds with solid track records, the manager could have trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use. The SEC requires that funds have at least 80 of assets in the particular type of investment implied by their title. How the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager. However, the categories that qualify for 80 of the assets can be vague and wide-ranging. End-of-Day Trading Only A mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash at any time. However, unlike stocks and ETFs that trade throughout the day, mutual fund redemptions can only take place at the end of the trading day. Taxes When the mutual fund manager sells a security, a capital-gains tax is triggered, which can be extended to you. ETFs, for example, avoid this through their creation and redemption mechanism. Your taxes can be lowered by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in a tax-deferred account, such as a 401k or IRA . Mutual Fund Fees When investing in mutual funds, its essential to understand the fees associated with them since these costs will significantly affect your investment returns over time. Here are some common mutual fund fees Expense ratio This is an annual fee that covers the funds operating expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and marketing expenses. The expense ratio is given as a percentage of the funds average net assets and is deducted from the funds returns. Pressured by competition from index investing and ETFs, mutual funds have lowered the expense ratio by more than half over the last 30 years see below. Sales charges or loads Some mutual funds charge sales fees, known as loads , when you buy or sell shares. Front-end loads are charged when you buy shares, while back-end loads or contingent and deferred sales charges are assessed if you sell your shares before a certain date. Sometimes, however, management firms offer no-load mutual funds , which dont have commission or sales charges. Redemption fees Some mutual funds charge a redemption fee when you sell shares within a short period usually 30 to 180 days after purchasing them, which the SEC limits to 2. This fee is designed to discourage short-term trading in these funds for stability. Other account fees Some funds or brokerage firms may charge extra fees for maintaining your account or transactions, especially if your balance falls below a certain minimum. Evaluating Mutual Funds Researching and comparing funds can be more difficult than for other securities. Unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price-to-earnings PE ratio, sales growth, earnings per share , or other important data. A mutual funds NAV can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. Only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely comparable. Watch Out for Diworsification Diworsification a play on words that defines the conceptis an investment term for when too much complexity can lead to worse results. Many mutual fund investors tend to over-complicate matters. That is, they acquire too many funds that are too similar and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification. Mutual Funds vs. Index Funds Index funds are mutual funds that aim to replicate the performance of a market benchmark or index. For example, an SP 500 index fund tracks that index by holding the 500 companies in the same proportions. A key goal of index funds is minimizing costs to mirror their index closely. By contrast, actively managed mutual funds try to beat the market by stock picking and shifting allocations. The fund manager seeks to achieve returns greater than a benchmark through their investing strategy and research. Index funds offer market returns at lower costs, while active mutual funds aim for higher returns through skilled management that often comes at a higher price. When deciding between index or actively managed mutual fund investing, investors should consider costs, time horizons, and risk appetite. Mutual Funds vs. ETFs Mutual funds and ETFs are pooled investment funds that offer investors a stake in a diversified portfolio. However, there are some crucial differences. Among the most important is that ETF shares are traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks, while mutual fund shares are traded only once daily after markets close. This means ETFs can be traded anytime during market hours, offering more liquidity, flexibility, and real-time pricing. This flexibility means you can short sell them or engage in the many strategies you would use for stocks. Another significant difference is pricing and valuation. ETF prices, like stocks, fluctuate throughout the day according to supply and demand. Meanwhile, mutual funds are priced only at the end of each trading day based on the NAV of the underlying portfolio. This also means that ETFs have the potential for larger premiumsdiscounts to NAV than mutual funds. Compared with mutual funds , ETFs tend to have certain tax advantages and are often more cost-efficient. Are Mutual Funds Safe Investments? All investments involve some degree of risk when purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual fundsand the actual risk of a particular mutual fund will depend on its investment strategy, holdings, and managers competence. Unlike deposits at banks and credit unions, the money invested in mutual funds isnt FDIC or otherwise insured. Can I Withdraw Money From a Mutual Fund Anytime? Yes. Mutual funds are generally highly liquid investments, meaning you can redeem your shares on any business day. However, there may be fees or penalties associated with early withdrawals, such as redemption fees or short-term trading fees, which some funds impose to discourage people from frequently trading in and out of the funds. Withdrawing funds may have tax implications, particularly if the investment has appreciated in value, which means youll have to pay taxes on the capital gains. Do You Actually Make Money in Mutual Funds? Yes, many make money for retirement and other savings goals through capital gains distributions, dividends, and interest income. As securities in the mutual funds portfolio increase in value, the value of the funds shares typically rises, leading to capital gains. However, returns are not guaranteed, and the performance of a mutual fund depends on market conditions, the funds management, what assets it holds, and its investment strategy. What Are the Risks of Mutual Funds? Depending on the assets they hold, mutual funds carry several investment risks, including market, interest rate, and management risk . Market risk arises from the potential decline in the value of the securities within the fund. Interest rate risk affects funds holding bonds and other fixed-income securities, as rising interest rates can decrease bond prices. Management risk is linked to the performance of the funds management team. You are putting your money in their hands, and poor investment decisions will negatively impact your returns. The Bottom Line Mutual funds are versatile and accessible for those looking to diversify their portfolios. These funds pool money from investors for stocks, bonds, real estate, derivatives, and other securitiesall managed for you. Key benefits include access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios and choosing funds tailored to different objectives and risk tolerances. However, mutual funds come with fees and expenses, including annual fees, expense ratios, or commissions, that will help determine your overall returns. Investors can choose from many types of mutual funds, such as stock, bond, money market, index, and target-date funds, each with its investment focus and strategy. The returns on mutual funds come from dividends or interest and selling fund shares at a profit.",

    "text": "Definition An exchange-traded fund pools a group of securities into a fund and can be traded like an individual stock on an exchange. What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund ETF? An exchange-traded fund ETF is an investment fund that holds multiple underlying assets and can be bought and sold on an exchange, much like an individual stock. ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of stockseven specific investment strategies. Various ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, or hedging risk in an investors portfolio . The first ETF in the U.S. was the SPDR SP 500 ETF SPY , which tracks the SP 500 Index . Key Takeaways An exchange-traded fund is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock. ETF share prices fluctuate throughout the trading day unlike mutual funds, which only trade once a day after the market closes. ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer brokerage commissions than buying stocks individually. Investopedia Zoe Hansen How ETFs Work An ETF must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. In the United States, most ETFs are set up as open-ended funds and are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements. Open-ended funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product. Vanguards Consumer Staples ETF VDC tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 2550 Index and has a minimum investment of 1.00. The fund holds shares of all 104 companies on the index, some familiar to most because they produce or sell consumer items. A few of the companies held by VDC are Proctor Gamble, Costco, Coca-Cola, Walmart, and PepsiCo. There is no transfer of ownership because investors buy a share of the fund, which owns the shares of the underlying companies. Unlike mutual funds, ETF share prices are determined throughout the day. A mutual fund trades only once a day after the markets close. Important Volatility is limited with an ETF because its holdings are diversified. Industry ETFs are also used to rotate in and out of sectors during economic cycles . Cash Invested in ETFs by Year Types of ETFs Passive ETFs Passive ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a broader indexeither a diversified index such as the SP 500 or a more targeted sector or trend. Actively managed ETFs These ETFs dont target an index. Instead, portfolio managers make decisions about which securities to buy and sell. Actively managed ETFs have benefits over passive ETFs but charge higher fees. Bond ETFs Used to provide regular income to investors. Distribution depends on the performance of underlying bonds which may include government, corporate, and state and local bonds, usually called municipal bonds . Unlike their underlying instruments, bond ETFs do not have a maturity date. Industry or sector ETFs A basket of stocks that track a single industry or sector like automotive or energy. The aim is to provide diversified exposure to a single industry, one that includes high performers and new entrants with growth potential. BlackRocks iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW , for example, tracks the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.545 Capped Index. Commodity ETFs Invest in commodities like crude oil or gold. Commodity ETFs can diversify a portfolio. Holding shares in a commodity ETF is cheaper than physical possession of the commodity. Currency ETFs Track the performance of currency pairs and can be used to speculate on the exchange rates of currencies based on political and economic developments in a country. Some use them to diversify a portfolio while importers and exporters use them to hedge against volatility in currency markets. Bitcoin ETFs The spot Bitcoin ETF was approved by the SEC in 2024 . These ETFs expose investors to bitcoins price moves in their regular brokerage accounts by purchasing and holding bitcoin as the underlying asset. Bitcoin futures ETFs , approved in 2021, use futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and track the price movements of bitcoin futures contracts. Ethereum ETFs Spot ether ETFs provide a way to invest in ether , the currency native to the Ethereum blockchain, without directly owning the cryptocurrency. In May 2024, the SEC permitted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the NYSE to list ETFs holding ether. And in July 2024 , the SEC officially approved nine spot ether ETFs to begin trading on U.S. exchanges. Inverse ETFs Earn gains from stock declines without having to short stocks . An inverse ETF uses derivatives to short a stock. Inverse ETFs are exchange-traded notes ETNs and not true ETFs. An ETN is a bond that trades like a stock and is backed by an issuer such as a bank. Leveraged ETFs A leveraged ETF seeks to return some multiples e.g., 2 or 3 on the return of the underlying investments. If the SP 500 rises 1, a 2 leveraged SP 500 ETF will return 2 and if the index falls by 1, the ETF would lose 2. These products use debt and derivatives, such as options or futures contracts, to leverage their returns. Fast Fact There are 10 ETFs focused on companies engaged in gold mining, excluding inverse and leveraged ETFs and those with relatively low assets under management AUM . Pros and Cons of ETFs Pros Exposure to many stocks across various industries Low expense ratios and commissions Risk management through diversification Can focus on targeted industries or commodities Cons Actively managed ETFs have higher fees Single-industry-focused ETFs limit diversification Lack of liquidity hinders transactions How to Invest in ETFs ETFs trade through online brokers and traditional broker-dealers . Many sources provide pre-screened brokers in the ETF industry. Individuals can also purchase ETFs in their retirement accounts. An alternative to standard brokers is a robo-advisor like Betterment and Wealthfront . An ETFs expense ratio is the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically have low expenses because they track an index. ETFs are available on most online investing platforms, retirement account provider sites, and investing apps like Robinhood. Most of these platforms offer commission-free trading, meaning that investors dont have to pay fees to the platform providers to buy or sell ETFs. After creating and funding a brokerage account, investors can search for ETFs and buy and sell as wanted. One of the best ways to narrow ETF options is to utilize an ETF screening tool with criteria such as trading volume, expense ratio, past performance, holdings, and commission costs.

Some ETFs track an index of stocks , thus creating a broad portfolio, while others target specific industries. SPDR SP 500 SPY The oldest and most widely known ETF tracks the SP 500. iShares Russell 2000 IWM An ETF that tracks the Russell 2000 small-cap index. Invesco QQQ QQQ Known as cubes, tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average DIA Known as diamonds, tracks the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA . Sector ETFs ETFs that track individual industries and sectors such as oil OIH , energy XLE , financial services XLF , real estate investment trusts IYR , and biotechnology BBH . Commodity ETFs These ETFs track commodities, including gold GLD , silver SLV , crude oil USO , and natural gas UNG . Country ETFs Funds that track the primary stock indexes in foreign countries but are traded in the U.S. in dollars. Examples include China MCHI , Brazil EWZ , Japan EWJ , and Israel EIS . Others track foreign markets across multiple countries, such as emerging market economies EEM and developed market economies EFA . ETFs vs. Mutual Funds vs. Stocks Most stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds can be bought and sold without a commission. Funds and ETFs differ from stocks because some of them charge management fees, though fees have been trending lower for years. ETFs tend to have lower fees than mutual funds. Exchange-Traded Funds Mutual Funds Stocks What They Are Track a basket of securities or commodities. Pooled investments into bonds, securities, and other instruments. Shares in listed companies. Prices Can trade at a premium or at a loss to the net asset value NAV of the fund. Trade at the net asset value of the overall fund. Based on their actual performance in the markets. How Theyre Traded Traded during regular market hours, just like stocks. Can be bought and sold only at the end of a trading day. Traded during regular market hours. Fees Can be purchased commission-free and are generally cheaper than mutual funds. Some do not charge load fees, but most are more expensive than ETFs because they charge management fees. Can be purchased commission-free on some platforms and generally do not have charges associated with them after purchase. Ownership of Securities ETFs do not involve actual ownership of securities by retail investors. Mutual funds own the securities in their basket. Stocks involve ownership of the security. Risk Diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and instruments. Diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and security instruments. Risk is concentrated in a stocks performance. Diversity would have to be achieved by buying other stocks. Active vs. Passive Equity Funds Dividends and Taxes ETF investors can also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated to investors. ETF shareholders are entitled to a share of earned interest or dividends and may get a residual value if the fund is liquidated . An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund because most buying and selling occur through an exchange, and the ETF sponsor doesnt need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell shares of the ETF. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares, they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund. Creation and Redemption The supply of ETF shares is regulated through creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors called authorized participants APs . When an ETF manager wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the indexsuch as the SP 500 tracked by the fundand sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit. When an AP sells stocks to the ETF sponsor in return for shares in the ETF, the block of shares used in the transaction is called a creation unit . If an ETF closes with a share price of 101 and the value of the stocks that the ETF owns is only worth 100 on a per-share basis, then the funds price of 101 was traded at a premium to the funds net asset value NAV . The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF. An AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process called redemption . The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the funds assets. ETFs in the United Kingdom The U.K. ETF market is one of the largest and most diverse in Europe. ETFs listed on the London Stock Exchange LSE offer exposure to various asset classes and markets, including equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, real estate, and alternative investments. Buying ETFs in the U.K. allows inclusion in Individual Savings Accounts ISAs, which are tax-efficient savings vehicles that allow people to invest up to 20,000 per year without paying any income or capital gains tax on their returns. Another benefit is that ETFs attract no stamp duty, which is a tax levied on ordinary share transactions in the U.K. Investors can buy shares in U.S.-listed companies from the U.K., but regulations prohibit the purchase of U.S.-listed ETFs in the U.K. Some U.K.-based ETFs track U.S. markets they have UCITS Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities in their name. This means the fund is fully regulated in the U.K. and allowed to track U.S. investments. Several ETFs track the FTSE 100 index for broad exposure to U.K. equities. These consist of the 100 largest publicly listed companies in the country. The HSBC FTSE UCITS ETF is listed on the London Stock Exchange and trades under the ticker symbol HUKX. The ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.07 and a dividend yield of 3.56 as of April 2025. What Was the First Exchange-Traded Fund? The distinction of being the first exchange-traded fund is often given to the SPDR SP 500 ETF SPY launched by State Street Global Advisors on Jan. 22, 1993. There were, however, some precursors to SPY, including Index Participation Units listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX , which tracked the Toronto 35 Index and appeared in 1990. How Is an ETF Different From an Index Fund? An index fund usually refers to a mutual fund that tracks an index. An index ETF is constructed in much the same way and will hold the stocks of an index. However, the difference between an index fund and an ETF is that an ETF tends to be more cost-effective and liquid than an index mutual fund. You can also buy an ETF throughout the trading day, while a mutual fund trades via a broker after the close of each trading day. Do ETFs Provide Diversification? Nearly all ETFs provide diversification relative to an individual stock purchases. Still, some ETFs are highly concentratedeither in the number of different securities they hold or in the weighting of those securities. For example, a fund may concentrate half of its assets in two or three positions, offering less diversification than other funds with broader asset distribution. The Bottom Line Exchange-traded funds represent a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a broad basket of securities with a limited budget. Investors can build a portfolio that holds one or many ETFs . Instead of buying individual stocks, investors buy shares of a fund that targets a representative cross-section of the wider market. However, there can be additional expenses to keep in mind when investing in an ETF.",

    "text": "Definition An index is a collection of a group of assets such as stocks and bonds thats used to track the performance of a specific sector or the broader market. What Is an Index? A financial index produces a numeric score based on inputs such as a variety of asset prices. It can be used to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market. These could be constructed as a broad-based index that captures the entire market, such as the Standard Poors 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, or more specialized, such as indexes that track a particular industry or segment, such as the Russell 2000 Index, which tracks only small-cap stocks. Key Takeaways Indexes in financial markets are often used as benchmarks to evaluate an investments performance against. Some of the most important indices in the U.S. markets are the SP 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Passive index investing has become a popular low-cost way to replicate the returns of popular indices such as the SP 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average. Benchmarking your investment strategy against the appropriate index is key to understanding a portfolios performance. Investopedia Mira Norian How Indexes Work Indexes are also created to measure other financial or economic data such as interest rates, inflation, or manufacturing output. Indexes often serve as benchmarks against which to evaluate the performance of a portfolios returns. One popular investment strategy, known as indexing , is to try to replicate such an index in a passive manner rather than trying to outperform it. Indexes in finance are typically used to track a statistical measure of change in various security prices. In finance, it typically refers to a statistical measure of change in a securities market. In the case of financial markets, stock and bond market indexes consist of a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a particular market or a segment of it. You cannot invest directly in an index. The SP 500 Index and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index are common benchmarks for the U.S. stock and bond markets, respectively. In reference to mortgages, it refers to a benchmark interest rate created by a third party. Each index related to the stock and bond markets has its own calculation methodology. In most cases, the relative change of an index is more important than the actual numeric value representing the index. For example, if the FTSE 100 Index is at 6,670.40, that number tells investors the index is nearly seven times its base level of 1,000. However, to assess how the index has changed from the previous day, investors must look at the amount the index has fallen, often expressed as a percentage. Index Investing Indexes are also often used as benchmarks against which to measure the performance of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ETFs. For instance, many mutual funds compare their returns to the return in the SP 500 Index to give investors a sense of how much more or less the managers are earning on their money than they would make in an index fund . Indexing is a form of passive fund management. Instead of a fund portfolio manager actively stock picking and market timingthat is, choosing securities to invest in and strategizing when to buy and sell themthe fund manager builds a portfolio wherein the holdings mirror the securities of a particular index. The idea is that by mimicking the profile of the indexthe stock market as a whole, or a broad segment of itthe fund will match its performance as well. Since you cannot invest directly in an index, index funds are created to track their performance. These funds incorporate securities that closely mimic those found in an index, thereby allowing an investor to bet on its performance, for a fee. An example of a popular index fund is the Vanguard SP 500 ETF VOO , which closely mirrors the SP 500 Index. When putting together mutual funds and ETFs, fund sponsors attempt to create portfolios mirroring the components of a certain index. This allows an investor to buy a security likely to rise and fall in tandem with the stock market as a whole or with a segment of the market. Fast Fact The largest exchange-traded fund ETF that tracks the SP 500 is the Vanguard SP 500 ETF VOO, closely followed by the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust SPY. Index Examples The SP 500 Index is one of the worlds best-known market proxy indexes and one of the most commonly used benchmarks for the stock market. It includes 80 of the total stocks traded in the United States. Conversely, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is also well known, but represents stock values from just 30 of the nations publicly traded companies. Other prominent indexes include the Nasdaq 100 Index , Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index , MSCI EAFE Index , and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. Like mutual funds, indexed annuities are tied to a trading index. However, rather than the fund sponsor trying to put together an investment portfolio likely to closely mimic the index in question, these securities feature a rate of return that follows a particular index but typically have caps on the returns they provide. For example, if an investor buys an annuity indexed to the Dow Jones and it has a cap of 10, its rate of return will be between 0 and 10, depending on the annual changes to that index. Indexed annuities allow investors to buy securities that grow along with broad market segments or the total market. Adjustable-rate mortgages feature interest rates that adjust over the life of the loan. The adjustable interest rate is determined by adding a margin to an index. One of the most popular indices on which mortgages are based is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR. For example, if a mortgage indexed to the SOFR has a 2 margin and the SOFR is 3, the interest rate on the loan is 5. What Is an Index Fund? An index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that seeks to replicate the performance of an index, often by constructing its portfolio to mirror that of the index itself. Index investing is considered a passive strategy since it does not involve stock picking or active management. Studies show that over time, indexing strategies tend to perform better than stock-picking strategies. Because they are passive, index funds also tend to have lower fees and tax exposure. What Are Different Ways to Construct an Index? Indexes can be built in a number of ways, often with consideration of how to weight the various components of the index. The three main ways include A market-cap, or capitalization-weighted index , puts more weight in the index to those components that have the largest market capitalization market value, such as the SP 500 A price-weighted index puts more weight on those components with the highest prices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average An equal-weighted index allocates each component with the same weights this is sometimes called an unweighted index Why Are Indexes Useful? Indexes are useful for providing valid benchmarks against which to measure investment performance for a given strategy or portfolio. By understanding how a strategy does relative to a benchmark, one can understand its true performance. Indexes also provide investors with a simplified snapshot of a large market sector, without having to examine every single asset in that index. For example, it would be impractical for an ordinary investor to study hundreds of different stock prices in order to understand the changing fortunes of different technology companies. A sector-specific index can show the average trend for the sector. What Are Some Major Stock Indexes? In the United States, the leading stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the SP 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Russell 2000. For international markets, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 FTSE 100 Index and the Nikkei 225 Index are popular proxies for the British and Japanese stock markets, respectively. Most countries with stock exchanges publish at least one index for their major stocks. What Are Some Bond Indexes? While stock market indexes may most often come to mind, indexes are also constructed around other asset classes. In the bond market, for example, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index tracks the investment-grade bond market, while the Emerging Market Bond Index looks at government bonds of emerging market economies. The Bottom Line Market indexes provide a broad representation of how markets are performing. These indices serve as benchmarks to gauge the movement and performance of market segments. Investors also use indexes as a basis for portfolio or passive index investing. In the U.S., such representative indexes include the large-cap SP 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100.",

    "text": "Investing differs from trading in that investing is for the long-term, usually years or decades. Investing is one of the key strategies to building long-term wealth and financial security. A Beginners Guide to Investing Investing An Introduction By Peter Gratton Updated Feb 06, 2025 What Are Stock Fundamentals? By Ben McClure Updated Jul 09, 2023 How To Start Investing in Stocks in 2025 and Beyond By Peter Gratton Updated Dec 03, 2024 How Do I Keep Commissions and Fees From Eating Trading Profits? By Chris Gallant Updated Apr 03, 2024 4 Basic Things To Know About Bonds By Eric Fontinelle Updated Apr 28, 2025 Frequently Asked Questions Can I start investing with 1000? Yes, many brokerages have no minimum account size and will offer zero-commission trading, allowing you to begin investing with even very small amounts. In fact, now with many brokers offering fractional shares, you can invest in stocks even if their share price is over 1000. Learn More How to Invest 1,000 How do I invest in stocks? While there are many ways to invest in stocks, one of the easiest and best ways for beginning investors to do so is to open up a retirement account with a discount broker. These accounts have tax advantages when saving for retirement and many different brokers have ones that cost little or even nothing to have. Learn More Best Investment Accounts for Young Investors How can I invest with no money? While you cant invest with zero money, you can invest with very little. Many stock brokers offer accounts with no minimum balance and no trading commissions so almost any amount you add to your account can be used to invest. Learn More How to Invest When Youre Broke Why should I invest? You should invest because investing allows your savings to go farther than they otherwise would. Simply holding your savings as cash means it will just sit and be slowly diluted by inflation, whereas even in the safest investments it will earn some money for you, building on itself. Learn More Why Should I Consider Investing? When should I start investing? As soon as you can afford to. Because investment returns compound, that is, the money you earn from investing then earns money, the sooner you begin investing, the more time you give for this process to work. Learn More 5 Advantages of Investing in Your 20s What time does the stock market open and close? In the U.S. stock markets major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and Nasdaq are open from 930 .a.m to 4.p.m Eastern Time. However, this varies around the world depending on what exchange youre looking at and whether that day is a holiday. Learn More Stock Market Opening Times Around the World Key Terms Bond Bond Yield Technical Analysis Sector Breakdown Short-Term Investments Investment Banker Wall Street Bond A bond is an investment representing part or all of a loan to a person, government, or other entity. Bonds are issued at a set par value, usually 1000 or 100, and their prices fluctuates based on interest rates and perceived credit-worthiness of the borrower. Learn More Bond Yield A bonds yield is the investment return that an investor will gain from a bond, usually expressed as a percentage. This is the percent of the bonds price that each set interest payment will be. Yields go up as a bonds price goes down and vice versa because they are a percent of the bonds value, therefore the higher the bonds price, the lower a percentage of that value a set interest payment will be. Learn More Technical Analysis Technical analysis is a form of stock analysis that involves looking at the price movements of stocks over time in order to predict where they will go. It attempts to find patterns in stock movements based on statistical trends such as the moving average of a stock or its trading volume. This contrasts with fundamental analysis which looks at the financial values of the business that issued the stock and economic conditions affecting the market and that business in order to assess where a stocks price will go. Learn More Sector Breakdown A sector breakdown is a way to look at a portfolio by organizing it by which sector of the economy each stock is in. This allows an investor to, depending on their investing strategy, avoid stocks from companies in sectors they dont believe to have strong prospects, focus on stocks from sectors they believe are in a good position for growth, or ensure their portfolio is diversified.

    "text": "What Is Inflation? Inflation is a gradual loss of purchasing power that is reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time. The inflation rate is calculated as the average price increase of a basket of selected goods and services over one year. High inflation means that prices are increasing quickly, while low inflation means that prices are growing more slowly. Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when prices decline and purchasing power increases. Key Takeaways Inflation measures how quickly the prices of goods and services are rising. Inflation is classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. The most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index. Inflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint and rate of change. Those with tangible assets may like to see some inflation as it raises the value of their assets. What Is Inflation? Understanding Inflation An increase in the money supply is the root of inflation, though this can play out through different mechanisms in the economy. A countrys money supply can be increased by the monetary authorities by Printing and giving away more money to citizens Legally devaluing reducing the value of the legal tender currency Loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market Other causes of inflation include supply bottlenecks and shortages of key goods, which can push prices to rise. When inflation occurs, money loses its purchasing power. This can occur across any sector or throughout an entire economy. The expectation of inflation itself can further sustain the devaluation of money. Workers may demand higher wages and businesses may charge higher prices, in anticipation of sustained inflation. This, in turn, reinforces the factors that push prices up. Melissa Ling Investopedia, 2019 Types of Inflation Inflation can be classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-Pull Effect Demand-pull inflation occurs when an increase in the supply of money and credit stimulates the overall demand for goods and services to increase more rapidly than the economys production capacity. This increases demand and leads to price rises. When people have more money, it leads to positive consumer sentiment. This, in turn, leads to higher spending, which pulls prices higher. It creates a demand-supply gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices. Cost-Push Effect Cost-push inflation is a result of the increase in prices working through the production process inputs. When additions to the supply of money and credit are channeled into a commodity or other asset markets, costs for all kinds of intermediate goods rise. This is especially evident when theres a negative economic shock to the supply of key commodities. These developments lead to higher costs for the finished product or service and work their way into rising consumer prices. For instance, when the money supply is expanded, it creates a speculative boom in oil prices . This means that the cost of energy can rise and contribute to rising consumer prices, which is reflected in various measures of inflation. Built-In Inflation Built-in inflation is related to adaptive expectations or the idea that people expect current inflation rates to continue in the future. As the price of goods and services rises, people may expect a continuous rise in the future at a similar rate. As such, workers may demand more costs or wages to maintain their standard of living. Their increased wages result in a higher cost of goods and services, and this wage-price spiral continues as one factor induces the other and vice versa. How Inflation Impacts Prices While it is easy to measure the price changes of individual products over time, human needs extend beyond just one or two products. Individuals need a big and diversified set of products as well as a host of services to live a comfortable life. They include commodities like food grains, metal, fuel, utilities like electricity and transportation, and services like healthcare , entertainment, and labor. Inflation aims to measure the overall impact of price changes for a diversified set of products and services. It allows for a single value representation of the increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a specified time. Prices rise, which means that one unit of money buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nations money supply growth outpaces economic growth. 3 The increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPI-U over the 12 months ending January 2025 on an unadjusted basis. Prices increased by 0.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis in January 2025 from the previous month. To combat this, the monetary authority in most cases, the central bank takes the necessary steps to manage the money supply and credit to keep inflation within permissible limits and keep the economy running smoothly. Theoretically, monetarism is a popular theory that explains the relationship between inflation and the money supply of an economy. For example, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, massive amounts of gold and silver flowed into the Spanish and other European economies. Since the money supply rapidly increased, the value of money fell, contributing to rapidly rising prices. Inflation is measured in a variety of ways depending on the types of goods and services. It is the opposite of deflation , which indicates a general decline in prices when the inflation rate falls below 0. Keep in mind that deflation shouldnt be confused with disinflation , which is a related term referring to a slowing down in the positive rate of inflation. Julie Bang Investopedia How to Protect Your Finances During Inflation There are a range of measures that individuals can take to protect their finances against inflation. For instance, one may choose to invest in asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary times. This might include commodities like grain, beef, oil, electricity, and natural gas. Commodity prices typically stay one step ahead of product prices, and price increases for commodities are often seen as an indicator of inflation to come. Commodities, which can also be volatile, are easily affected by natural disasters, geopolitics, or conflict. Real estate income may also help buffer against inflation, as landlords can increase their rent to keep pace with the rise of prices overall. The U.S. government also offers Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a type of security indexed to inflation to protect against declines in purchasing power. Types of Price Indexes Depending upon the selected set of goods and services used, multiple types of baskets of goods are calculated and tracked as price indexes. The most commonly used price indexes are the Consumer Price Index CPI and the Wholesale Price Index WPI . Consumer Price Index CPI The CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of goods and services that are of primary consumer needs. They include transportation, food, and medical care. CPI is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them based on their relative weight in the whole basket. The prices in consideration are the retail prices of each item, as available for purchase by the individual citizens. CPI can impact the value of one currency against those of other nations. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living , making it one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS reports the CPI each month and has calculated it as far back as 1913. Important The CPI-U, which was introduced in 1978, represents the buying habits of approximately 88 of the noninstitutional population of the United States. Wholesale Price Index WPI The WPI is another popular measure of inflation. It measures and tracks the changes in the price of goods in the stages before the retail level. While WPI items vary from one country to another, they mostly include items at the producer or wholesale level. For example, it includes cotton prices for raw cotton, cotton yarn, cotton gray goods, and cotton clothing. Although many countries and organizations use the WPI, many other countries, including the U.S., use a similar variant called the Producer Price Index PPI . Producer Price Index PPI The PPI is a family of indexes that measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers of intermediate goods and services over time. The PPI measures price changes from the perspective of the seller and differs from the CPI, which measures price changes from the perspective of the buyer. In all variants, the rise in the price of one component say oil may cancel out the price decline in another say wheat to a certain extent. Overall, each index represents the average weighted price change for the given constituents which may apply at the overall economy , sector, or commodity level. The Formula for Measuring Inflation The above-mentioned variants of price indexes can be used to calculate the value of inflation between two particular months or years. While a lot of ready-made inflation calculators are already available on various financial portals and websites, it is always better to be aware of the underlying methodology to ensure accuracy with a clear understanding of the calculations. Mathematically, Percent Inflation Rate Final CPI Index Value Initial CPI Value 100 Say you wish to know how the purchasing power of 10,000 changed between January 1975 and January 2024. One can find price index data on various portals in a tabular form. From that table, pick up the corresponding CPI figures for the given two months. For September 1975, it was 52.1 initial CPI value, and for January 2024, it was 308.417 final CPI value. Plugging in the formula yields Percent Inflation Rate 308.417 52.1 100 5.9197 100 591.97 Since you wish to know how much 10,000 from January 1975 would be worth in January 2024, multiply the inflation rate by the amount to get the changed dollar value Change in Dollar Value 5.9197 10,000 59,197 This means that 10,000 in January 1975 will be worth 59,197 today. Essentially, if you purchased a basket of goods and services as included in the CPI definition worth 10,000 in 1975, the same basket would cost you 59,197 in January 2024. Advantages and Disadvantages of Inflation Inflation can be construed as either a good or a bad thing, depending upon which side one takes, and how rapidly the change occurs. Advantages Individuals with tangible assets like property or stocked commodities priced in their home currency may like to see some inflation as that raises the price of their assets, which they can sell at a higher rate. Inflation often leads to speculation by businesses in risky projects and by individuals who invest in company stocks because they expect better returns than inflation. An optimum level of inflation is often promoted to encourage spending to a certain extent instead of saving. If the purchasing power of money falls over time, there may be a greater incentive to spend now instead of saving and spending later. It may increase spending, which may boost economic activities in a country. A balanced approach is thought to keep the inflation value in an optimum and desirable range. Disadvantages Buyers of such assets may not be happy with inflation, as they will be required to shell out more money. People who hold assets valued in their home currency, such as cash or bonds, may not like inflation, as it erodes the real value of their holdings. As such, investors looking to protect their portfolios from inflation should consider inflation-hedged asset classes, such as gold, commodities, and real estate investment trusts REITs. Inflation-indexed bonds are another popular option for investors to profit from inflation . High and variable rates of inflation can impose major costs on an economy. Businesses, workers, and consumers must all account for the effects of generally rising prices in their buying, selling, and planning decisions. This introduces an additional source of uncertainty into the economy, because they may guess wrong about the rate of future inflation. Time and resources expended on researching, estimating, and adjusting economic behavior are expected to rise to the general level of prices. Thats opposed to real economic fundamentals, which inevitably represent a cost to the economy as a whole. Even a low, stable, and easily predictable rate of inflation, which some consider otherwise optimal, may lead to serious problems in the economy. Thats because of how, where, and when the new money enters the economy. Whenever new money and credit enter the economy, it is always in the hands of specific individuals or business firms. The process of price level adjustments to the new money supply proceeds as they then spend the new money and it circulates from hand to hand and account to account through the economy. Inflation does drive up some prices first and drives up other prices later. This sequential change in purchasing power and prices known as the Cantillon effect means that the process of inflation not only increases the general price level over time but also distorts relative prices , wages, and rates of return along the way. Economists, in general, understand that distortions of relative prices away from their economic equilibrium are not good for the economy, and Austrian economists even believe this process to be a major driver of cycles of recession in the economy. Pros Leads to higher resale value of assets Optimum levels of inflation encourage spending Cons Buyers have to pay more for products and services Imposes higher prices on the economy Drives some prices up first and others later How Inflation Can Be Controlled A countrys financial regulator shoulders the important responsibility of keeping inflation in check. It is done by implementing measures through monetary policy , which refers to the actions of a central bank or other committees that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply. In the U.S., the Feds monetary policy goals include moderate long-term interest rates, price stability, and maximum employment. Each of these goals is intended to promote a stable financial environment. The Federal Reserve clearly communicates long-term inflation goals in order to keep a steady long-term rate of inflation , which is thought to be beneficial to the economy. Price stability or a relatively constant level of inflation allows businesses to plan for the future since they know what to expect. The Fed believes that this will promote maximum employment, which is determined by non-monetary factors that fluctuate over time and are therefore subject to change. For this reason, the Fed doesnt set a specific goal for maximum employment, and it is largely determined by employers assessments. Maximum employment does not mean zero unemployment, as at any given time there is a certain level of volatility as people vacate and start new jobs. Hyperinflation is often described as a period of inflation of 50 or more per month. Monetary authorities also take exceptional measures in extreme conditions of the economy. For instance, following the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Fed kept the interest rates near zero and pursued a bond-buying program called quantitative easing QE . Some critics of the program alleged it would cause a spike in inflation in the U.S. dollar, but inflation peaked in 2007 and declined steadily over the next eight years. There are many complex reasons why QE didnt lead to inflation or hyperinflation , though the simplest explanation is that the recession itself was a very prominent deflationary environment, and quantitative easing supported its effects. Consequently, U.S. policymakers have attempted to keep inflation steady at around 2 per year. The European Central Bank ECB has also pursued aggressive quantitative easing to counter deflation in the eurozone, and some places have experienced negative interest rates . Thats due to fears that deflation could take hold in the eurozone and lead to economic stagnation. Moreover, countries that experience higher rates of growth can absorb higher rates of inflation. Indias target is around 4 with an upper tolerance of 6 and a lower tolerance of 2, while Brazil aims for 3.25 with an upper tolerance of 4.75 and a lower tolerance of 1.75. Meaning of Inflation, Deflation, and Disinflation While a high inflation rate means that prices are increasing, a low inflation rate does not mean that prices are falling. Counterintuitively, when the inflation rate falls, prices are still increasing, but at a slower rate than before. When the inflation rate falls but remains positive, this is known as disinflation . Conversely, if the inflation rate becomes negative, that means that prices are falling. This is known as deflation , which can have negative effects on an economy. Because buying power increases over time, consumers have less incentive to spend money in the short term, resulting in falling economic activity. Hedging Against Inflation Stocks are considered to be the best hedge against inflation , as the rise in stock prices is inclusive of the effects of inflation. Since additions to the money supply in virtually all modern economies occur as bank credit injections through the financial system, much of the immediate effect on prices happens in financial assets that are priced in their home currency, such as stocks. Special financial instruments exist that one can use to safeguard investments against inflation. They include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a low-risk treasury security that is indexed to inflation where the principal amount invested is increased by the percentage of inflation. One can also opt for a TIPS mutual fund or TIPS-based exchange-traded fund ETF . To get access to stocks, ETFs, and other funds that can help avoid the dangers of inflation, youll likely need a brokerage account. Choosing a stockbroker can be a tedious process due to the variety among them. Gold is also considered to be a hedge against inflation, although this doesnt always appear to be the case looking backward. Examples of Inflation Since all world currencies are fiat money , the money supply could increase rapidly for political reasons, resulting in rapid price level increases. The most famous example is the hyperinflation that struck the German Weimar Republic in the early 1920s. The nations that were victorious in World War I demanded reparations from Germany, which could not be paid in German paper currency, as this was of suspect value due to government borrowing. Germany attempted to print paper notes, buy foreign currency with them, and use that to pay their debts. This policy led to the rapid devaluation of the German mark along with the hyperinflation that accompanied the development. German consumers responded to the cycle by trying to spend their money as fast as possible, understanding that it would be worth less and less the longer they waited. More money flooded the economy, and its value plummeted to the point where people would paper their walls with practically worthless bills. Similar situations occurred in Peru in 1990 and in Zimbabwe between 2007 and 2008. What Causes Inflation? There are three main causes of inflation demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-pull inflation refers to situations where there are not enough products or services being produced to keep up with demand, causing their prices to increase. Cost-push inflation, on the other hand, occurs when the cost of producing products and services rises, forcing businesses to raise their prices. Built-in inflation which is sometimes referred to as a wage-price spiral occurs when workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs. This, in turn, causes businesses to raise their prices in order to offset their rising wage costs, leading to a self-reinforcing loop of wage and price increases. Is Inflation Good or Bad? Too much inflation is generally considered bad for an economy, while too little inflation is also considered harmful. Many economists advocate for a middle ground of low to moderate inflation, of around 2 per year. Generally speaking, higher inflation harms savers because it erodes the purchasing power of the money they have saved however, it can benefit borrowers because the inflation-adjusted value of their outstanding debts shrinks over time. What Are the Effects of Inflation? Inflation can affect the economy in several ways. For example, if inflation causes a nations currency to decline, this can benefit exporters by making their goods more affordable when priced in the currency of foreign nations. On the other hand, this could harm importers by making foreign-made goods more expensive. Higher inflation can also encourage spending, as consumers will aim to purchase goods quickly before their prices rise further. Savers, on the other hand, could see the real value of their savings erode, limiting their ability to spend or invest in the future. Why Was Inflation So High in 2024? Inflation has remained elevated since 2022 when inflation rates around the world rose to their highest levels since the early 1980s. While there is no single reason for this rapid rise in global prices, a series of events worked together to boost inflation to such high levels. The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and other restrictions that greatly disrupted global supply chains, from factory closures to bottlenecks at maritime ports. Governments also issued stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits to counter the financial impact on individuals and small businesses. When vaccines became widespread and the economy bounced back, demand fueled in part by stimulus money and low interest rates quickly outpaced supply, which struggled to get back to pre-COVID levels. Russias unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Russia, limiting the worlds supply of oil and gas since Russia is a large producer of fossil fuels. Food prices also rose as Ukraines large grain harvests could not be exported. As fuel and food prices rose, it led to similar increases down the value chains. The Fed raised interest rates to combat the high inflation, which significantly came down in 2023, though it remains above pre-pandemic levels . The Bottom Line Inflation is a rise in prices, which results in the decline of purchasing power over time. Inflation is natural and the U.S. government targets an annual inflation rate of 2 however, inflation can be dangerous when it increases too much, too fast. Inflation makes items more expensive, especially if wages do not rise by the same levels of inflation. Additionally, inflation erodes the value of some assets, especially cash. Governments and central banks seek to control inflation through monetary policy.",

    "text": "Definition An interest rate is the price an entity pays for borrowing money or the fee they charge for lending it, expressed as a percentage. What Is an Interest Rate? The interest rate is the percentage of interest relative to the principal . It is either what lenders charge borrowers or what is earned from deposit accounts. The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis and is expressed as an annual percentage rate APR. An interest rate can also apply to a savings account or a certificate of deposit CD. In this case, a bank or credit union pays a percentage of the funds deposited to the account holder. Annual percentage yield APY refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts. Key Takeaways An interest rate also applies to the amount earned at a bank or credit union from a deposit account. Most mortgages use simple interest. However, some loans use compound interest, which is applied to the principal but also to the accumulated interest of previous periods. A loan that is considered low-risk by the lender will have a lower interest rate. A loan that is considered high-risk will have a higher interest rate. The APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. Savings accounts and CDs use compound interest. Investopedia Julie Bang Understanding Interest Rates In lending, interest is a charge to the borrower for the use of an asset. Assets borrowed can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and property. Because of this, an interest rate can be thought of as the cost of money. Higher interest rates make borrowing the same amount of money more expensive. Interest rates apply to most lending or borrowing transactions. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes, fund projects, launch or fund businesses, or pay for college tuition. Businesses take out loans to fund capital projects and expand their operations by purchasing fixed and long-term assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. Borrowed money is repaid either in a lump sum by a pre-determined date or in periodic installments. For loans, the interest rate is applied to the principal, which is the amount of the loan. The interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The money to be repaid is usually more than the borrowed amount since lenders require compensation for the loss of use of the money during the loan period. The lender could have invested the funds during that period instead of providing a loan, which would have generated income from the asset. The difference between the total repayment sum and the original loan is the interest charged. When the loan is considered to be low risk by the lender, the borrower will usually be charged a lower interest rate. If the loan is considered high risk, the interest rate that the borrower is charged will be higher. Important Risk is typically assessed when a lender looks at a potential borrowers credit score, which is why its important to have an excellent one if you want to qualify for the best loans. Simple Interest Rate If you take out a 300,000 loan from the bank and the loan agreement stipulates that the interest rate on the loan is 4 simple interest, this means that you will have to pay the bank the original loan amount of 300,000 4 x 300,000 300,000 12,000 312,000. The example above was calculated based on the annual simple interest formula, which is Simple interest principal x interest rate x time The individual who took out the loan will have to pay 12,000 in interest at the end of the year, assuming it was only a one-year lending agreement. If the loan was a 30-year mortgage, the interest payment will be Simple interest 300,000 x 4 x 30 360,000 A simple interest rate of 4 annually translates into an annual interest payment of 12,000. After 30 years, the borrower would have made 12,000 x 30 years 360,000 in interest payments. Compound Interest Rate Some lenders prefer the compound interest method, which means that the borrower pays even more in interest. Compound interest, also called interest on interest , is applied both to the principal and also to the accumulated interest made during previous periods. The bank assumes that at the end of the first year the borrower owes the principal plus interest for that year. The bank also assumes that at the end of the second year, the borrower owes the principal plus the interest for the first year plus the interest on interest for the first year. The interest owed when compounding is higher than the interest owed using the simple interest method. The interest is charged monthly on the principal, including accrued interest from the previous months. For shorter time frames, the calculation of interest will be similar for both methods. As the lending time increases, however, the disparity between the two types of interest calculations grows. Using the example above, at the end of 30 years, the total owed in interest is almost 673,019 on a 300,000 loan with a 4 interest rate. The following formula can be used to calculate compound interest Compound interest p x 1 interest rate n 1 where p principal n number of compounding periods Lets look at another example. Jayati takes out a three-year loan of 10,000 at an interest rate of 5, which compounds annually. In the end, as worked out in the calculation below, she pays 1,576.25 in interest on the loan 10,000 1 0.05 3 1 10,000 1.157625 1 1,576.25 Compound Interest and Savings Accounts When you save money using a savings account, compound interest is favorable. The interest earned on these accounts is compounded and serves as compensation to the account holder for allowing the bank to use the deposited funds. If, for example, you deposit 500,000 into a high-yield savings account , the bank can take 300,000 of these funds to use as a mortgage loan. To compensate you, the bank pays 5 interest into the account annually. So, while the bank is taking 8 from the borrower, it is giving 5 to you, the account holder, netting it 3 in interest. In effect, savers lend the bank money which, in turn, provides funds to borrowers in return for interest. APR vs. APY Interest rates on consumer loans are typically quoted as the annual percentage rate APR . This is the rate of return that lenders demand for the ability to borrow their money. For example, the interest rate on credit cards is quoted as an APR. In our example above, 4 is the APR for the mortgage . The APR does not consider compounded interest for the year. The annual percentage yield APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. This interest rate takes compounding into account. How Are Interest Rates Determined? The interest rate charged by banks is determined by a number of factors, including the state of the economy. A countrys central bank e.g., the Federal Reserve in the U.S. sets the interest rate, which each bank uses to determine the APR range they offer. When the central bank sets interest rates at a high level, the cost of debt rises. When the cost of debt is high, it discourages people from borrowing and slows consumer demand. Interest rates tend to rise with inflation . In a high-interest-rate economy, businesses have limited access to capital funding through debt, which can lead to economic contraction. Economies are often stimulated during periods of low interest rates because borrowers have access to loans at inexpensive rates. Since interest rates on savings are low, businesses and individuals are more likely to spend and purchase riskier investment vehicles such as stocks. This spending fuels the economy and provides an injection to capital markets leading to economic expansion. While governments prefer lower interest rates, they eventually lead to market disequilibrium where demand exceeds supply, causing inflation. When inflation occurs, interest rates increase, which may relate to Walras law . 6.85 The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in February 2025. This was slightly down from 6.90 a year earlier. Interest Rates and Race There is evidence that suggests that white people get approved more often for mortgages. Data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the most comprehensive publicly-available information on mortgage market activity, showed that Black, Hispanic, and Asian applicants were denied conventional mortgage loans in 2023 17.1, 12.1, and 9.7 of the time, respectively. The denial rate for white applicants, on the other hand, was lower at 6.8. Evidence of interest rate discrimination with mortgages has been confirmed by other sources, including Harvard University and the Urban Institute, which found in 2022 that the average Black homeowner gets charged an interest rate that is 33 basis points higher than the average white homeowner, and pays about 250 more per year in interest. Not everybody agrees with these findings. A study by economists at the Federal Reserve Board concluded that no racial group gets preferential treatment, leading its authors to speculate that reporting of disparities elsewhere may be due to many Black and Hispanic borrowers tending to choose slightly higher interest rates in return for lower up-front costs. The Federal Reserve Board believes discrimination is improving and credits this, in part, to a rise in automated underwriting and stricter enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Why Are Interest Rates on 30-year Loans Higher than on 15-year Loans? Interest rates are a function of the risk of default and the opportunity cost . Longer loans and debts are inherently more risky, as there is more time for the borrower to default. The same time, the opportunity cost is also larger over longer time periods, as the principal is tied up and cannot be used for any other purpose. How Does the Fed Use Interest Rates? The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, uses interest rates as a monetary policy tool. By increasing the cost of borrowing among commercial banks, the central bank can influence many other interest rates, such as those for personal loans, business loans, and mortgages. This makes borrowing more expensive in general, lowering the demand for money and cooling off a hot economy. Lowering interest rates, on the other hand, makes money easier to borrow, stimulating spending and investment. Why Do Bond Prices React Inversely to Interest Rate Changes? A bond is a debt instrument that typically pays a fixed rate of interest over its lifetime. Say that prevailing interest rates are 5. If a bond is priced at par 1,000 and has an interest rate coupon of 5, it will pay bondholders 50 a year. If interest rates rise to 10, new bonds issued will pay doublei.e., 100 per 1,000 in face value . An existing bond that only pays 50 will have to sell at a steep discount in order for somebody to want to buy it. Likewise, if interest rates drop to 1, new bonds will only pay 10 per 1,000 in face value. Hence, a bond that pays 50 will be in high demand and its price will be bid up quite high. The Bottom Line An interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. When you take out a loan, you are expected to pay the entity lending you money something extra as compensation. Likewise, if you deposit money in a savings account, the financial institution may reward you because it can use part of this money to make more loans to its customers. These charges or payments are called interest and are applied at a specified rate.",

    "text": "Definition A stock, also called an equity or a share, is an ownership stake in the corporation that issued it. What Are Stocks? A stock is a security that represents ownership of a fraction of the corporation that issued it. Units of stock are called shares and entitle the owner to a portion of the corporations profits equal to the number of shares owned. Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on public exchanges. The exchanges and the stocks that are listed on them are required to conform to government regulations meant to protect investors from fraudulent practices. Key Takeaways A stock is proof of ownership of a fractional percentage of the company that issued it. Corporations issue stock to raise money to operate or expand their businesses. There are two main types of stock common and preferred. Historically, stocks outperform most other investments over the long run. Understanding Stocks Corporations issue stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. The holder of stock, a shareholder, may have a claim to part of the companys assets and earnings. A shareholder is considered an owner of the issuing company, determined by the number of shares an investor owns relative to the number of outstanding shares . If a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares, that person would own and have a claim to 10 of the companys assets and earnings . Stockholders do not own a corporation, but corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons. Corporations file taxes, can borrow, can own property, and can be sued. The idea that a corporation is a person means that the corporation owns its assets . A corporate office full of chairs and tables belongs to the corporation, and not to the shareholders. Corporate property is legally separated from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability of both the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets sold, but a shareholders assets are not at risk. The court cannot force you to sell your shares, although the value of your shares may have fallen. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, they cannot sell the companys assets to pay their creditors . Shareholder A person, company, or institution that owns at least one share of a companys stock What Is Shareholder Ownership? What shareholders own are shares issued by the corporation, and the corporation owns the assets held by a firm. If you own 33 of the shares of a company, it is incorrect to assert that you own one-third of that company. However, you do own one-third of the companys shares. This is known as separation of ownership and control. Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive dividends if and when they are distributed, and the right to sell your shares to somebody else. If you own a majority of shares, your voting power increases so that you can indirectly control the direction of a company by appointing its board of directors. This becomes most apparent when one company buys another. The acquiring company buys all the outstanding shares. The board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the corporation and often does so by hiring professional managers, or officers, such as the chief executive officer CEO . Ordinary shareholders do not manage the company. The importance of being a shareholder is that you are entitled to a portion of the companys profits, which is the foundation of a stocks value. The more shares you own, the larger the portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, however, do not pay out dividends and instead reinvest profits back into growing the company. These retained earnings , however, are still reflected in the value of a stock. Tip Read about Investopedias 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special-issue print edition. How to Compare Common and Preferred Stock There are two main types of stock common and preferred . Common stock usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders meetings and to receive any dividends paid out by the corporation. Preferred stockholders generally do not have voting rights , though they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stockholders. For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before common shareholders and have priority if a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated. Fast Fact The first common stock ever issued was by the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Companies can issue new shares whenever there is a need to raise additional cash. This process dilutes the ownership and rights of existing shareholders provided that they do not buy any of the new offerings. Corporations can also engage in stock buybacks, which benefit existing shareholders because they cause their shares to appreciate in value. What Is the Difference Between Stocks and Bonds? Stocks are issued by companies to raise capital to grow the business or undertake new projects. There are important distinctions between whether somebody buys shares directly from the company when it issues them in the primary market or from another shareholder in the secondary market . When the corporation issues shares, it does so in return for money. Bonds vary from stocks in several ways. Bondholders are creditors to the corporation and are entitled to interest as well as repayment of the principal invested. Also, creditors are given legal priority over other stakeholders in the event of a bankruptcy and will be made whole first if a company is forced to sell assets . Conversely, shareholders often receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy, implying that stocks are inherently riskier investments than bonds. How Do You Buy Stock? Most often, stocks are bought and sold on stock exchanges , such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange NYSE. After a company goes public through an initial public offering IPO, its stock becomes available for investors to buy and sell on an exchange. Typically, investors will use a brokerage account to purchase stock on the exchange, which will list the purchasing price the bid or the selling price the offer. The price of the stock is influenced by supply and demand factors in the market, among other variables. How Can You Earn Income from Owning Stock? There are two ways to earn money by owning shares of stock through dividends and capital appreciation. Dividends are cash distributions of company profits. If a company has 1,000 shares outstanding and declares a 5,000 dividend, then stockholders will get 5 for each share they own. Capital appreciation is the increase in the share price itself. If you sell a share to someone for 10, and the stock is later worth 11, the shareholder has made 1. Is It Risky to Own Stock? All investments have a degree of risk . Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds ETFs can lose value if market conditions decline. When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions or corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company. Historically, stocks have outperformed most other investments over the long run. The Bottom Line A stock represents fractional ownership of equity in an organization. It is different from a bond, which operates like a loan made by creditors to the company in return for periodic payments. A company issues stock to raise capital from investors for new projects or to expand its business operations. The type of stock , common or preferred, held by a shareholder determines the rights and benefits of ownership.",

    "text": "Definition A bond is a fixed-income instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower thats typically a corporate or government entity. What Is a Bond? A bond is a fixed-income instrument and investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a certain interest rate for an amount of time. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower. Key Takeaways A bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate or coupon to debtholders. Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice-versa. Bonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default. Investopedia Ellen Lindner How Bonds Work Bonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure. Corporations often borrow to grow their business , buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees. Bonds are fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be paid back. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate . The initial price of most bonds is typically set at par or 1,000 face value per individual bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures. Fast Fact Markets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individualslong after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date . Characteristics of Bonds Face value or Par Value The value of the bond at maturity and the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments. Coupon Rate The rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage. Coupon Dates The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Maturity Date The date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond. Issue Price The price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In many cases, bonds are issued at par . Bond Categories There are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms. Corporate Bonds Companies issue corporate bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates. Municipal Bonds Issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors. Government Bonds Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called Bills, bonds issued with one10 years to maturity are called notes, and government bonds issued with more than 10 years to maturity are called bonds. The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as treasuries . Agency Bonds Issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are considered agency bonds . Bond Prices and Interest Rates A bonds price changes daily where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bonds price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa. The issuer of a fixed-rate bond promises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a 1,000 par, 10 annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder 100 each year. If prevailing market interest rates are also 10 at the time that this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return 100. However, if interest rates drop to 5, the investor can only receive 50 from the government bond but would still receive 100 from the corporate bond. Investors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environmentin this case, the bond will trade at 2,000 so that the 100 coupon represents 5. Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15, then an investor could make 150 from the government bond and would not pay 1,000 to earn just 100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case to a price of 666.67. Yield-to-Maturity YTM The yield-to-maturity YTM is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate. YTM is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled. YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate. YTM. Investopedia Investors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1 change in interest rates. This practical definition is the modified duration of a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes. How To Invest in Bonds While there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and TIPS are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via its TreasuryDirect website. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds . Investors can also take a look at Investopedias list of the best online stock brokers . Image by Sabrina Jiang Â Investopedia 2020 Bond Variations The bonds available for investors come in many different varieties, depending on the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes. Zero-Coupon Bonds Z-bonds Do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. U.S. Treasury bills are zero-coupon bonds . Convertible Bonds Debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock equity at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price. Callable Bonds Have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond can be called back by the company before it matures. A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value. Puttable Bonds allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured. This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders. What Determines a Bonds Coupon Rate? Two features of a bondcredit quality and time to maturityare the principal determinants of a bonds coupon rate. If the issuer has a poor credit rating , the risk of default is greater, and these bonds pay more interest. Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed to interest rate and inflation risks for an extended period. How Are Bonds Rated? Credit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies like Standard and Poors , Moodys , and Fitch Ratings . The very highest quality bonds are called investment grade and include debt issued by the U.S. government and very stable companies, such as many utilities. Bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called high yield or junk bonds. These bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk. What Is Duration? Bonds and bond portfolios will rise or fall in value as interest rates change. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called duration . The use of the term duration in this context can be confusing to new bond investors because it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. Instead, duration describes how much a bonds price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates. The Bottom Line Bonds are issued by companies and governments to finance projects and fund operations. A bond is considered a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate to debtholders. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers or buy government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website.",

    "text": "Definition A mutual fund is a financial vehicle that pools money from shareholders to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. A mutual fund pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. For millions of Americans, these funds are the cornerstone of their retirement savings, offering professional management and built-in diversification that would be difficult to achieve on their own. In a mutual fund, investors pool their money to buy assets together, benefiting from shared costs and professional expertise. Rather than buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy shares in the fund itself, becoming partial owners of all its holdings. When you invest in a mutual fund, youre essentially hiring professional money managers to make investment decisions on your behalf. These managers research opportunities, select securities, and monitor performance according to the funds stated objectiveswhether thats aggressive growth, steady income, or matching a market index. Key Takeaways Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to build diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds and other securities managed by finance professionals. Fund shares are priced once daily at market close based on the net asset value NAV of all holdings minus expenses divided by total shares. Investors can earn returns through capital gains when fund holdings increase in value, dividend and interest distributions, or selling shares for a profit. Key benefits include professional management, diversification, and relatively low investment minimums, though fees and expenses can impact returns. Most Americans invest in mutual funds through employer retirement plans like 401ks, with over half of U.S. households owning fund shares. Investopedia Ellen Lindner Mutual Funds How Many is Too Many? How Mutual Funds Work Mutual funds are portfolios of investments funded by all those who have bought shares in the fund. When someone buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all the funds underlying assets. The funds performance depends on its assetsif its full of stocks going up, it will go up. If theyre going down, so, too, will the fund. While a mutual fund manager oversees the portfolio, deciding how to divide money across sectors, industries, companies, etc., based on the funds strategy, many mutual funds are so-called index or passive funds , with portfolios that shouldnt need too much management. They simply mirror the assets of indexes like the SP 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The biggest fund managers are Vanguard and Fidelity . Tip The reason mutual funds are so often the default for retirement accounts like 401ks is that they let you instantly diversify across hundreds of securities with a relatively modest amount of money. The number of American households invested in mutual funds has increased significantly since they were introduced about half a century ago, from about 6 of households in 1980 to about 53 in the mid-2020s, including about 35 of Gen Z households. Together, American households own about 88 of all mutual fund assets. Mutual funds give everyday investors access to a diverse investment menu they likely couldnt build on their own. Rather than putting all your money into one stock or bondwhich can be riskya mutual fund spreads your investments across many different securities. How To Invest in Mutual Funds Investing in mutual funds is relatively straightforward, involving the following steps Before buying shares, you should check with your employer to see if they offer mutual funds through your 401k or other retirement funds since these might have matching fundsessentially doubling what you put in. Once you know you wont be investing in mutual funds through work, make sure you have a brokerage account with enough deposited to buy the mutual fund shares you want. Identify mutual funds that match your investing goals regarding risk, returns, fees, and minimum investments. Many platforms offer fund screening tools. Determine how much you want to invest and submit your trade. To increase your investment over time, you can often set up automatic periodic purchases of shares. While these investments are often long-term, you should periodically check the funds performance and adjust as needed. When its time to close your position, enter a sell order on your platform. Types of Mutual Funds There are many types among the more than 8,800 mutual funds in the U.S., with most in four main categories stock, money market, bond, and target-date funds. Target Date Funds The Set-It-and-Forget-It Approach Target date funds offer a straightforward approach to retirement investing by automatically adjusting their mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on when you plan to retire. These mutual funds, which often have years like 2045 or 2050 in their names, start with aggressive growth strategies and gradually become more conservative as you approach retirement. These funds require active managementbut not from you. Earlier in your career, the fund might invest 90 of your money in stocks for growth potential. As you near retirement, it shifts more money into bonds and cash to help protect your nest egg from market swings. For example, a 30-year-old planning to retire in 2065 might choose a 2065 Target Date Fund. Initially, this fund would primarily hold stocks. Over time, it automatically rebalances to include more conservative investments, cutting down on risk when you can least afford major losses. However, target date funds arent one-size-fits-all. Their fees can vary significantly, and their investment strategiesknown as glide pathsdiffer among fund companies. Some funds maintain significant stock exposure even after retirement, while others take a more conservative approach. Important More than 90 of employee retirement plans in the U.S. use target date funds as their default. Stock Funds This type of fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are assorted subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in firms with small-, mid-, or large-sized capitalization . Others are named by their investment approach aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in U.S. stocks or foreign equities. To understand how these strategies and sizes of assets can combine, you can use an equity-style box like the example below. Value funds invest in stocks their managers see as undervalued while aiming at long-term appreciation when the market recognizes the stocks true worth. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings PE ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and dividend yields. Meanwhile, growth funds look to companies with solid earnings, sales, and cash flow growth. These companies typically have high price-to-earnings ratios and do not pay much in dividends. A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a blend. These funds invest in a mix of growth and value stocks to give a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in the middle. InvestopediaJulie Bang Large-cap companies have market capitalizations of over 10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically for blue-chip firms whose names are recognizable. Small-cap stocks have a market cap between 250 million and 2 billion. These companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Mid-cap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap. A mutual fund may combine different investment styles and company sizes. For example, a large-cap value fund might include in its portfolio large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall these would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box large and value. The opposite of this would be a small-cap growth fund that invests in startup technology companies with high growth prospects. This kind of fund is in the bottom right quadrant above small and growth. Bond Funds A mutual fund that generates a consistent and minimum return is part of the fixed-income category. These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments . The bonds should generate interest income thats passed on to the shareholders, with limited investment risk. There are also actively managed funds that look for relatively undervalued bonds to sell them at a profit. These mutual funds will likely pay higher returns but arent without risk. For example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities. Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where and when they invest, and all bond funds have interest rate risk . Tip Most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies or fund families such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer. Index Funds Index mutual funds are designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the SP 500. This passive strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so fewer expenses are passed on to investors through fees, and these funds are designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind. They also frequently outperform actively managed mutual funds and thus potentially are the rare combination in life of lower costs and better performance. Balanced Funds Balanced funds invest across different securities, whether stocks, bonds, the money market , or alternative investments. The objective of these funds, known as an asset-allocation fund, is to cut risk through diversification. Money Market Funds The money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. The returns on them arent substantial. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the average certificate of deposit CD . Money market mutual funds are often used as a temporary holding place for cash that will be used for future investments or for an emergency fund. While low risk, they arent insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC like savings accounts or CDs. Income Funds Income funds are meant to disburse income on a steady basis, and are often seen as the mutual funds for retirement investing. They invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. While fund holdings may rise in value, the primary goal is to offer a steady cash flow. International Funds An international mutual fund , or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investors home country. Global funds, however, can invest anywhere worldwide. Their volatility depends on where and when the funds are invested. Sector and Theme Funds Sector mutual funds aim to profit from the performance of specific industries, such as finance, technology, or healthcare. Theme funds can cut across sectors. For example, a fund focused on AI might have holdings in firms in healthcare, defense, and other areas employing and building out AI beyond the tech industry. Socially Responsible Mutual Funds Socially responsible investing invest only in companies and sectors that meet preset criteria. For example, some socially responsible funds do not invest in industries like tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power. Sustainable mutual funds invest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling. There are also funds that review environmental, social, and governance factors when choosing investments. This approach focuses on the companys management practices and whether they tend toward environmental and community improvement. Top Mutual Funds Below are five large mutual funds that represent a range of the types of funds listed above Vanguard 500 Index Fund VFIAX The oldest such mutual fund, VFIAX tracks the SP 500 Index , making it a way to invest in 500 of Americas largest companies with a single purchase. With a very low 0.04 expense ratio meaning you pay 40 cents annually per 1,000 invested, it requires a 3,000 minimum investment. Since its launch half a century ago, the fund has returned an average of about 8.27 annually. Fidelity 500 Index Fund FXAIX Like Vanguards offering, it charges even less, just 0.015 in annual expenses 15 cents per 1,000 invested and has no minimum investment requirement. The fund invests in technology, financial, healthcare and consumer companies, closely matching the SP 500 index while maintaining flexibility to invest up to 20 outside the index. T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund PRDGX This actively managed fund focuses on companies that consistently pay and increase their regular cash payments to shareholders. While its 0.64 expense ratio is higher than index funds, the strategy targets stable, financially healthy companies. The minimum investment is 2,500. Fidelity ZERO International Index Fund FZILX For investors seeking global diversification, this fund offers exposure to non-U.S. companies with no fees, a 0 expense ratio. The fund focuses on established international companies to help manage risk while providing worldwide investment exposure. Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund VBTLX This fund provides broad exposure to U.S. bonds, primarily government, and high-quality corporate debt. With a 0.05 expense ratio and a 3,000 minimum investment, its designed to provide steady income and help balance out the stock markets risks. Tip While many mutual funds are no-load, you can frequently avoid brokerage fees and commissions anyway by purchasing a fund directly from the mutual fund company instead of going through an intermediary. How Mutual Fund Shares Are Priced The value of the mutual fund depends on the performance of the securities it invests in. When buying a unit or share of a mutual fund, you get a part of its portfolio value. Investing in a share of a mutual fund differs from investing in stock shares. Unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give their holders voting rights. And unlike exchange-traded funds ETFs, you cant trade your shares throughout the trading day. Mutual fund share prices come from the net asset value NAV per share, sometimes listed as NAVPS . A funds NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the number of shares outstanding. Mutual fund shares are typically bought or redeemed at the funds NAV, which doesnt fluctuate during market hours but is settled at the end of each trading day. The price of a mutual fund is also updated when the NAVPS is settled. How Are Earnings Calculated for Mutual Funds? Investors typically earn returns from a mutual fund in three ways Dividendinterest income Mutual funds distribute the dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in its portfolio. Funds often give investors the choice of either receiving a deposit for distributions or reinvesting earnings for more shares in the mutual fund. Portfolio distributions If the fund sells securities that have increased in price, the fund realizes a capital gain , which most funds also pass on to investors in a distribution. Capital gains distribution When the funds shares increase in price, you can sell your mutual fund shares for a profit in the market. When researching the returns of a mutual fund, youll typically come upon a figure for the total return, or the net change in value either up or down over a specific period. This includes any interest, dividends, or capital gains the fund has generated along with the change in its market value during a given period. In most cases, total returns are given for one, five, and 10-year periods, as well as from the day the fund opened. Pros and Cons of Investing in Mutual Funds There are many reasons that mutual funds have been the retail investors vehicle of choice , with an overwhelming majority of money in employer-sponsored retirement plans invested in mutual funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular, has long paid very close attention to how these funds are run, given their importance to so many Americans and their retirements. Mutual Fund Pros Cons Pros Ability to buy and sell shares relatively quickly Diversification Minimal investment requirements Professional management Variety of offerings Cons Fees, commissions, and other expenses Large cash presence in portfolios No FDIC coverage Difficulty in comparing funds Lack of transparency in holdings Pros of Mutual Fund Investing Diversification A diversified portfolio has securities with different capitalizations and industries and bonds with varying maturities and issuers. A mutual fund can achieve diversification faster and more cheaply than buying individual securities. Ease of Access Trading on the major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. Also, for certain types of assets, like foreign equities or exotic commodities , mutual funds are often the most workablesometimes the onlyway for individual investors to participate. Economies of Scale Because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs are lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions. A mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could. Professional Management A mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. Mutual funds require much lower investment minimums, providing a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management. Transparency Mutual funds are subject to industry regulations meant to ensure accountability and fairness for investors. In addition, the component securities of each mutual fund can be found across many platforms. Tip Mutual fund managers are legally obligated to follow the funds stated mandate and to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders. Cons of Mutual Fund Investing Liquidity , diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options. However, there are drawbacks No FDIC Guarantee Like many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund will depreciate . Equity mutual funds experience price fluctuations, along with the stocks in the funds portfolio. The FDIC does not guarantee mutual fund investments. Cash Drag To maintain liquidity and the ability to accommodate withdrawals, mutual funds typically have to keep a larger percentage of their portfolio as cash than other investors. Because this cash earns no return, its called a cash drag. Higher Costs Fees that reduce your overall payout from a mutual fund are assessed whatever the performance of the fund. Failing to pay attention to the fees can cost you since actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate and compound year over year. Dilution Dilution is also the result of a successful fund growing too big. When new money pours into funds with solid track records, the manager could have trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use. The SEC requires that funds have at least 80 of assets in the particular type of investment implied by their title. How the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager. However, the categories that qualify for 80 of the assets can be vague and wide-ranging. End-of-Day Trading Only A mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash at any time. However, unlike stocks and ETFs that trade throughout the day, mutual fund redemptions can only take place at the end of the trading day. Taxes When the mutual fund manager sells a security, a capital-gains tax is triggered, which can be extended to you. ETFs, for example, avoid this through their creation and redemption mechanism. Your taxes can be lowered by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in a tax-deferred account, such as a 401k or IRA . Mutual Fund Fees When investing in mutual funds, its essential to understand the fees associated with them since these costs will significantly affect your investment returns over time. Here are some common mutual fund fees Expense ratio This is an annual fee that covers the funds operating expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and marketing expenses. The expense ratio is given as a percentage of the funds average net assets and is deducted from the funds returns. Pressured by competition from index investing and ETFs, mutual funds have lowered the expense ratio by more than half over the last 30 years see below. Sales charges or loads Some mutual funds charge sales fees, known as loads , when you buy or sell shares. Front-end loads are charged when you buy shares, while back-end loads or contingent and deferred sales charges are assessed if you sell your shares before a certain date. Sometimes, however, management firms offer no-load mutual funds , which dont have commission or sales charges. Redemption fees Some mutual funds charge a redemption fee when you sell shares within a short period usually 30 to 180 days after purchasing them, which the SEC limits to 2. This fee is designed to discourage short-term trading in these funds for stability. Other account fees Some funds or brokerage firms may charge extra fees for maintaining your account or transactions, especially if your balance falls below a certain minimum. Evaluating Mutual Funds Researching and comparing funds can be more difficult than for other securities. Unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price-to-earnings PE ratio, sales growth, earnings per share , or other important data. A mutual funds NAV can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. Only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely comparable. Watch Out for Diworsification Diworsification a play on words that defines the conceptis an investment term for when too much complexity can lead to worse results. Many mutual fund investors tend to over-complicate matters. That is, they acquire too many funds that are too similar and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification. Mutual Funds vs. Index Funds Index funds are mutual funds that aim to replicate the performance of a market benchmark or index. For example, an SP 500 index fund tracks that index by holding the 500 companies in the same proportions. A key goal of index funds is minimizing costs to mirror their index closely. By contrast, actively managed mutual funds try to beat the market by stock picking and shifting allocations. The fund manager seeks to achieve returns greater than a benchmark through their investing strategy and research. Index funds offer market returns at lower costs, while active mutual funds aim for higher returns through skilled management that often comes at a higher price. When deciding between index or actively managed mutual fund investing, investors should consider costs, time horizons, and risk appetite. Mutual Funds vs. ETFs Mutual funds and ETFs are pooled investment funds that offer investors a stake in a diversified portfolio. However, there are some crucial differences. Among the most important is that ETF shares are traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks, while mutual fund shares are traded only once daily after markets close. This means ETFs can be traded anytime during market hours, offering more liquidity, flexibility, and real-time pricing. This flexibility means you can short sell them or engage in the many strategies you would use for stocks. Another significant difference is pricing and valuation. ETF prices, like stocks, fluctuate throughout the day according to supply and demand. Meanwhile, mutual funds are priced only at the end of each trading day based on the NAV of the underlying portfolio. This also means that ETFs have the potential for larger premiumsdiscounts to NAV than mutual funds. Compared with mutual funds , ETFs tend to have certain tax advantages and are often more cost-efficient. Are Mutual Funds Safe Investments? All investments involve some degree of risk when purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual fundsand the actual risk of a particular mutual fund will depend on its investment strategy, holdings, and managers competence. Unlike deposits at banks and credit unions, the money invested in mutual funds isnt FDIC or otherwise insured. Can I Withdraw Money From a Mutual Fund Anytime? Yes. Mutual funds are generally highly liquid investments, meaning you can redeem your shares on any business day. However, there may be fees or penalties associated with early withdrawals, such as redemption fees or short-term trading fees, which some funds impose to discourage people from frequently trading in and out of the funds. Withdrawing funds may have tax implications, particularly if the investment has appreciated in value, which means youll have to pay taxes on the capital gains. Do You Actually Make Money in Mutual Funds? Yes, many make money for retirement and other savings goals through capital gains distributions, dividends, and interest income. As securities in the mutual funds portfolio increase in value, the value of the funds shares typically rises, leading to capital gains. However, returns are not guaranteed, and the performance of a mutual fund depends on market conditions, the funds management, what assets it holds, and its investment strategy. What Are the Risks of Mutual Funds? Depending on the assets they hold, mutual funds carry several investment risks, including market, interest rate, and management risk . Market risk arises from the potential decline in the value of the securities within the fund. Interest rate risk affects funds holding bonds and other fixed-income securities, as rising interest rates can decrease bond prices. Management risk is linked to the performance of the funds management team. You are putting your money in their hands, and poor investment decisions will negatively impact your returns. The Bottom Line Mutual funds are versatile and accessible for those looking to diversify their portfolios. These funds pool money from investors for stocks, bonds, real estate, derivatives, and other securitiesall managed for you. Key benefits include access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios and choosing funds tailored to different objectives and risk tolerances. However, mutual funds come with fees and expenses, including annual fees, expense ratios, or commissions, that will help determine your overall returns. Investors can choose from many types of mutual funds, such as stock, bond, money market, index, and target-date funds, each with its investment focus and strategy. The returns on mutual funds come from dividends or interest and selling fund shares at a profit.",

    "text": "Definition An exchange-traded fund pools a group of securities into a fund and can be traded like an individual stock on an exchange. What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund ETF? An exchange-traded fund ETF is an investment fund that holds multiple underlying assets and can be bought and sold on an exchange, much like an individual stock. ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of stockseven specific investment strategies. Various ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, or hedging risk in an investors portfolio . The first ETF in the U.S. was the SPDR SP 500 ETF SPY , which tracks the SP 500 Index . Key Takeaways An exchange-traded fund is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock. ETF share prices fluctuate throughout the trading day unlike mutual funds, which only trade once a day after the market closes. ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer brokerage commissions than buying stocks individually. Investopedia Zoe Hansen How ETFs Work An ETF must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. In the United States, most ETFs are set up as open-ended funds and are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements. Open-ended funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product. Vanguards Consumer Staples ETF VDC tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 2550 Index and has a minimum investment of 1.00. The fund holds shares of all 104 companies on the index, some familiar to most because they produce or sell consumer items. A few of the companies held by VDC are Proctor Gamble, Costco, Coca-Cola, Walmart, and PepsiCo. There is no transfer of ownership because investors buy a share of the fund, which owns the shares of the underlying companies. Unlike mutual funds, ETF share prices are determined throughout the day. A mutual fund trades only once a day after the markets close. Important Volatility is limited with an ETF because its holdings are diversified. Industry ETFs are also used to rotate in and out of sectors during economic cycles . Cash Invested in ETFs by Year Types of ETFs Passive ETFs Passive ETFs aim to replicate the performance of a broader indexeither a diversified index such as the SP 500 or a more targeted sector or trend. Actively managed ETFs These ETFs dont target an index. Instead, portfolio managers make decisions about which securities to buy and sell. Actively managed ETFs have benefits over passive ETFs but charge higher fees. Bond ETFs Used to provide regular income to investors. Distribution depends on the performance of underlying bonds which may include government, corporate, and state and local bonds, usually called municipal bonds . Unlike their underlying instruments, bond ETFs do not have a maturity date. Industry or sector ETFs A basket of stocks that track a single industry or sector like automotive or energy. The aim is to provide diversified exposure to a single industry, one that includes high performers and new entrants with growth potential. BlackRocks iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW , for example, tracks the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.545 Capped Index. Commodity ETFs Invest in commodities like crude oil or gold. Commodity ETFs can diversify a portfolio. Holding shares in a commodity ETF is cheaper than physical possession of the commodity. Currency ETFs Track the performance of currency pairs and can be used to speculate on the exchange rates of currencies based on political and economic developments in a country. Some use them to diversify a portfolio while importers and exporters use them to hedge against volatility in currency markets. Bitcoin ETFs The spot Bitcoin ETF was approved by the SEC in 2024 . These ETFs expose investors to bitcoins price moves in their regular brokerage accounts by purchasing and holding bitcoin as the underlying asset. Bitcoin futures ETFs , approved in 2021, use futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and track the price movements of bitcoin futures contracts. Ethereum ETFs Spot ether ETFs provide a way to invest in ether , the currency native to the Ethereum blockchain, without directly owning the cryptocurrency. In May 2024, the SEC permitted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the NYSE to list ETFs holding ether. And in July 2024 , the SEC officially approved nine spot ether ETFs to begin trading on U.S. exchanges. Inverse ETFs Earn gains from stock declines without having to short stocks . An inverse ETF uses derivatives to short a stock. Inverse ETFs are exchange-traded notes ETNs and not true ETFs. An ETN is a bond that trades like a stock and is backed by an issuer such as a bank. Leveraged ETFs A leveraged ETF seeks to return some multiples e.g., 2 or 3 on the return of the underlying investments. If the SP 500 rises 1, a 2 leveraged SP 500 ETF will return 2 and if the index falls by 1, the ETF would lose 2. These products use debt and derivatives, such as options or futures contracts, to leverage their returns. Fast Fact There are 10 ETFs focused on companies engaged in gold mining, excluding inverse and leveraged ETFs and those with relatively low assets under management AUM . Pros and Cons of ETFs Pros Exposure to many stocks across various industries Low expense ratios and commissions Risk management through diversification Can focus on targeted industries or commodities Cons Actively managed ETFs have higher fees Single-industry-focused ETFs limit diversification Lack of liquidity hinders transactions How to Invest in ETFs ETFs trade through online brokers and traditional broker-dealers . Many sources provide pre-screened brokers in the ETF industry. Individuals can also purchase ETFs in their retirement accounts. An alternative to standard brokers is a robo-advisor like Betterment and Wealthfront . An ETFs expense ratio is the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically have low expenses because they track an index. ETFs are available on most online investing platforms, retirement account provider sites, and investing apps like Robinhood. Most of these platforms offer commission-free trading, meaning that investors dont have to pay fees to the platform providers to buy or sell ETFs. After creating and funding a brokerage account, investors can search for ETFs and buy and sell as wanted. One of the best ways to narrow ETF options is to utilize an ETF screening tool with criteria such as trading volume, expense ratio, past performance, holdings, and commission costs.

Some ETFs track an index of stocks , thus creating a broad portfolio, while others target specific industries. SPDR SP 500 SPY The oldest and most widely known ETF tracks the SP 500. iShares Russell 2000 IWM An ETF that tracks the Russell 2000 small-cap index. Invesco QQQ QQQ Known as cubes, tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average DIA Known as diamonds, tracks the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA . Sector ETFs ETFs that track individual industries and sectors such as oil OIH , energy XLE , financial services XLF , real estate investment trusts IYR , and biotechnology BBH . Commodity ETFs These ETFs track commodities, including gold GLD , silver SLV , crude oil USO , and natural gas UNG . Country ETFs Funds that track the primary stock indexes in foreign countries but are traded in the U.S. in dollars. Examples include China MCHI , Brazil EWZ , Japan EWJ , and Israel EIS . Others track foreign markets across multiple countries, such as emerging market economies EEM and developed market economies EFA . ETFs vs. Mutual Funds vs. Stocks Most stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds can be bought and sold without a commission. Funds and ETFs differ from stocks because some of them charge management fees, though fees have been trending lower for years. ETFs tend to have lower fees than mutual funds. Exchange-Traded Funds Mutual Funds Stocks What They Are Track a basket of securities or commodities. Pooled investments into bonds, securities, and other instruments. Shares in listed companies. Prices Can trade at a premium or at a loss to the net asset value NAV of the fund. Trade at the net asset value of the overall fund. Based on their actual performance in the markets. How Theyre Traded Traded during regular market hours, just like stocks. Can be bought and sold only at the end of a trading day. Traded during regular market hours. Fees Can be purchased commission-free and are generally cheaper than mutual funds. Some do not charge load fees, but most are more expensive than ETFs because they charge management fees. Can be purchased commission-free on some platforms and generally do not have charges associated with them after purchase. Ownership of Securities ETFs do not involve actual ownership of securities by retail investors. Mutual funds own the securities in their basket. Stocks involve ownership of the security. Risk Diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and instruments. Diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and security instruments. Risk is concentrated in a stocks performance. Diversity would have to be achieved by buying other stocks. Active vs. Passive Equity Funds Dividends and Taxes ETF investors can also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated to investors. ETF shareholders are entitled to a share of earned interest or dividends and may get a residual value if the fund is liquidated . An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund because most buying and selling occur through an exchange, and the ETF sponsor doesnt need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell shares of the ETF. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares, they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund. Creation and Redemption The supply of ETF shares is regulated through creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors called authorized participants APs . When an ETF manager wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the indexsuch as the SP 500 tracked by the fundand sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit. When an AP sells stocks to the ETF sponsor in return for shares in the ETF, the block of shares used in the transaction is called a creation unit . If an ETF closes with a share price of 101 and the value of the stocks that the ETF owns is only worth 100 on a per-share basis, then the funds price of 101 was traded at a premium to the funds net asset value NAV . The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF. An AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process called redemption . The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the funds assets. ETFs in the United Kingdom The U.K. ETF market is one of the largest and most diverse in Europe. ETFs listed on the London Stock Exchange LSE offer exposure to various asset classes and markets, including equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, real estate, and alternative investments. Buying ETFs in the U.K. allows inclusion in Individual Savings Accounts ISAs, which are tax-efficient savings vehicles that allow people to invest up to 20,000 per year without paying any income or capital gains tax on their returns. Another benefit is that ETFs attract no stamp duty, which is a tax levied on ordinary share transactions in the U.K. Investors can buy shares in U.S.-listed companies from the U.K., but regulations prohibit the purchase of U.S.-listed ETFs in the U.K. Some U.K.-based ETFs track U.S. markets they have UCITS Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities in their name. This means the fund is fully regulated in the U.K. and allowed to track U.S. investments. Several ETFs track the FTSE 100 index for broad exposure to U.K. equities. These consist of the 100 largest publicly listed companies in the country. The HSBC FTSE UCITS ETF is listed on the London Stock Exchange and trades under the ticker symbol HUKX. The ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.07 and a dividend yield of 3.56 as of April 2025. What Was the First Exchange-Traded Fund? The distinction of being the first exchange-traded fund is often given to the SPDR SP 500 ETF SPY launched by State Street Global Advisors on Jan. 22, 1993. There were, however, some precursors to SPY, including Index Participation Units listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX , which tracked the Toronto 35 Index and appeared in 1990. How Is an ETF Different From an Index Fund? An index fund usually refers to a mutual fund that tracks an index. An index ETF is constructed in much the same way and will hold the stocks of an index. However, the difference between an index fund and an ETF is that an ETF tends to be more cost-effective and liquid than an index mutual fund. You can also buy an ETF throughout the trading day, while a mutual fund trades via a broker after the close of each trading day. Do ETFs Provide Diversification? Nearly all ETFs provide diversification relative to an individual stock purchases. Still, some ETFs are highly concentratedeither in the number of different securities they hold or in the weighting of those securities. For example, a fund may concentrate half of its assets in two or three positions, offering less diversification than other funds with broader asset distribution. The Bottom Line Exchange-traded funds represent a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a broad basket of securities with a limited budget. Investors can build a portfolio that holds one or many ETFs . Instead of buying individual stocks, investors buy shares of a fund that targets a representative cross-section of the wider market. However, there can be additional expenses to keep in mind when investing in an ETF.",

    "text": "Definition An index is a collection of a group of assets such as stocks and bonds thats used to track the performance of a specific sector or the broader market. What Is an Index? A financial index produces a numeric score based on inputs such as a variety of asset prices. It can be used to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market. These could be constructed as a broad-based index that captures the entire market, such as the Standard Poors 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, or more specialized, such as indexes that track a particular industry or segment, such as the Russell 2000 Index, which tracks only small-cap stocks. Key Takeaways Indexes in financial markets are often used as benchmarks to evaluate an investments performance against. Some of the most important indices in the U.S. markets are the SP 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Passive index investing has become a popular low-cost way to replicate the returns of popular indices such as the SP 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average. Benchmarking your investment strategy against the appropriate index is key to understanding a portfolios performance. Investopedia Mira Norian How Indexes Work Indexes are also created to measure other financial or economic data such as interest rates, inflation, or manufacturing output. Indexes often serve as benchmarks against which to evaluate the performance of a portfolios returns. One popular investment strategy, known as indexing , is to try to replicate such an index in a passive manner rather than trying to outperform it. Indexes in finance are typically used to track a statistical measure of change in various security prices. In finance, it typically refers to a statistical measure of change in a securities market. In the case of financial markets, stock and bond market indexes consist of a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a particular market or a segment of it. You cannot invest directly in an index. The SP 500 Index and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index are common benchmarks for the U.S. stock and bond markets, respectively. In reference to mortgages, it refers to a benchmark interest rate created by a third party. Each index related to the stock and bond markets has its own calculation methodology. In most cases, the relative change of an index is more important than the actual numeric value representing the index. For example, if the FTSE 100 Index is at 6,670.40, that number tells investors the index is nearly seven times its base level of 1,000. However, to assess how the index has changed from the previous day, investors must look at the amount the index has fallen, often expressed as a percentage. Index Investing Indexes are also often used as benchmarks against which to measure the performance of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ETFs. For instance, many mutual funds compare their returns to the return in the SP 500 Index to give investors a sense of how much more or less the managers are earning on their money than they would make in an index fund . Indexing is a form of passive fund management. Instead of a fund portfolio manager actively stock picking and market timingthat is, choosing securities to invest in and strategizing when to buy and sell themthe fund manager builds a portfolio wherein the holdings mirror the securities of a particular index. The idea is that by mimicking the profile of the indexthe stock market as a whole, or a broad segment of itthe fund will match its performance as well. Since you cannot invest directly in an index, index funds are created to track their performance. These funds incorporate securities that closely mimic those found in an index, thereby allowing an investor to bet on its performance, for a fee. An example of a popular index fund is the Vanguard SP 500 ETF VOO , which closely mirrors the SP 500 Index. When putting together mutual funds and ETFs, fund sponsors attempt to create portfolios mirroring the components of a certain index. This allows an investor to buy a security likely to rise and fall in tandem with the stock market as a whole or with a segment of the market. Fast Fact The largest exchange-traded fund ETF that tracks the SP 500 is the Vanguard SP 500 ETF VOO, closely followed by the SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust SPY. Index Examples The SP 500 Index is one of the worlds best-known market proxy indexes and one of the most commonly used benchmarks for the stock market. It includes 80 of the total stocks traded in the United States. Conversely, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is also well known, but represents stock values from just 30 of the nations publicly traded companies. Other prominent indexes include the Nasdaq 100 Index , Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index , MSCI EAFE Index , and the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. Like mutual funds, indexed annuities are tied to a trading index. However, rather than the fund sponsor trying to put together an investment portfolio likely to closely mimic the index in question, these securities feature a rate of return that follows a particular index but typically have caps on the returns they provide. For example, if an investor buys an annuity indexed to the Dow Jones and it has a cap of 10, its rate of return will be between 0 and 10, depending on the annual changes to that index. Indexed annuities allow investors to buy securities that grow along with broad market segments or the total market. Adjustable-rate mortgages feature interest rates that adjust over the life of the loan. The adjustable interest rate is determined by adding a margin to an index. One of the most popular indices on which mortgages are based is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR. For example, if a mortgage indexed to the SOFR has a 2 margin and the SOFR is 3, the interest rate on the loan is 5. What Is an Index Fund? An index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that seeks to replicate the performance of an index, often by constructing its portfolio to mirror that of the index itself. Index investing is considered a passive strategy since it does not involve stock picking or active management. Studies show that over time, indexing strategies tend to perform better than stock-picking strategies. Because they are passive, index funds also tend to have lower fees and tax exposure. What Are Different Ways to Construct an Index? Indexes can be built in a number of ways, often with consideration of how to weight the various components of the index. The three main ways include A market-cap, or capitalization-weighted index , puts more weight in the index to those components that have the largest market capitalization market value, such as the SP 500 A price-weighted index puts more weight on those components with the highest prices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average An equal-weighted index allocates each component with the same weights this is sometimes called an unweighted index Why Are Indexes Useful? Indexes are useful for providing valid benchmarks against which to measure investment performance for a given strategy or portfolio. By understanding how a strategy does relative to a benchmark, one can understand its true performance. Indexes also provide investors with a simplified snapshot of a large market sector, without having to examine every single asset in that index. For example, it would be impractical for an ordinary investor to study hundreds of different stock prices in order to understand the changing fortunes of different technology companies. A sector-specific index can show the average trend for the sector. What Are Some Major Stock Indexes? In the United States, the leading stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the SP 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Russell 2000. For international markets, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 FTSE 100 Index and the Nikkei 225 Index are popular proxies for the British and Japanese stock markets, respectively. Most countries with stock exchanges publish at least one index for their major stocks. What Are Some Bond Indexes? While stock market indexes may most often come to mind, indexes are also constructed around other asset classes. In the bond market, for example, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index tracks the investment-grade bond market, while the Emerging Market Bond Index looks at government bonds of emerging market economies. The Bottom Line Market indexes provide a broad representation of how markets are performing. These indices serve as benchmarks to gauge the movement and performance of market segments. Investors also use indexes as a basis for portfolio or passive index investing. In the U.S., such representative indexes include the large-cap SP 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100.",

    "text": "Definition Commodities are basic raw materials used in commerce that are interchangeable with other goods of the same type and are primarily utilized as inputs in the production of other goods and services. What Are Commodities? Commodities are raw materials used to manufacture consumer products. They are inputs in the production of other goods and services, rather than finished goods sold to consumers. In commerce, commodities are basic resources that are interchangeable with other goods of the same type. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When traded on an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards, also known as a basis grade . Key Takeaways A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. Investors and traders can buy and sell commodities directly in the spot cash market or via derivatives such as futures and options. Hard commodities refer to energy and metals products, while soft commodities are often agricultural goods. Many investors view allocating commodities in a portfolio as a hedge against inflation. Investopedia Joules Garcia Understanding Commodities Commodities are the raw inputs used in the production of goods. They may also be basic staples such as certain agricultural products. The important feature of a commodity is that there is very little differentiation in that good, regardless of who produces it. A barrel of oil is basically the same product, regardless of the producer. The same goes for a bushel of wheat or a ton of ore. By contrast, the quality and features of a given consumer product will often be quite different depending on the producer e.g., Coke vs. Pepsi. Some traditional examples of commodities include grains, gold, beef, oil, and natural gas. More recently, the definition has expanded to include financial products, such as foreign currencies and indexes. Commodities can be bought and sold on specialized exchanges as financial assets. There are also well-developed derivatives markets whereby you can buy contracts on such commodities e.g., oil forwards, wheat or gold futures, and natural gas options . Some experts believe that investors should hold at least some portion of a well-diversified portfolio in commodities since they are not highly correlated with other financial assets and may serve as an inflation hedge. Tip You might consider allocating up to 10 of your portfolio to a mix of commodities. Ordinary investors can look to one of several commodities ETFs or mutual funds to gain exposure. Buyers and Producers of Commodities The sale and purchase of commodities are usually carried out through futures contracts on exchanges that standardize the quantity and minimum quality of the commodity being traded. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade CBOT stipulates that one wheat contract is for 5,000 bushels and states what grades of wheat can be used to satisfy the contract. Two types of traders trade commodity futures. The first are buyers and producers of commodities that use commodity futures contracts for the hedging purposes for which they were originally intended. These traders make or take delivery of the actual commodity when the futures contract expires. For example, the wheat farmer who plants a crop can hedge against the risk of losing money if the price of wheat falls before the crop is harvested. The farmer can sell wheat futures contracts when the crop is planted and have a guaranteed, predetermined price for the wheat when it is harvested. Commodities Speculators The second type of commodities trader is the speculator . These are traders who trade in the commodities markets for the sole purpose of profiting from the volatile price movements. These traders never intend to make or take delivery of the actual commodity when the futures contract expires. Many futures markets are very liquid and have a high degree of daily range and volatility, making them very tempting markets for intraday traders. Many index futures are used by brokerages and portfolio managers to offset risk. Also, since commodities do not typically trade in tandem with equity and bond markets, some commodities can be used effectively to diversify an investment portfolio. Special Considerations Commodity prices typically rise when inflation accelerates, which is why investors often flock to them for their protection during times of increasing inflationparticularly when it is unexpected. So, commodity demand increases because investors flock to them, raising their prices. The prices of goods and services then go up to match the increase. This causes commodities to often serve as a hedge against a currencys decreased buying power when the inflation rate increases. What Is the Relationship Between Commodities and Derivatives? The modern commodities market relies heavily on derivative securities, such as futures and forward contracts. Buyers and sellers can transact with one another easily and in large volumes without needing to exchange the physical commodities themselves. Many buyers and sellers of commodity derivatives do so to speculate on the price movements of the underlying commodities for purposes such as risk hedging and inflation protection. What Determines Commodity Prices? Like all assets, commodity prices are ultimately determined by supply and demand . For example, a booming economy might lead to increased demand for oil and other energy commodities. Supply and demand for commodities can be impacted in many ways, such as economic shocks, natural disasters, and investor appetite investors may purchase commodities as an inflation hedge if they expect inflation to rise. What Is the Difference Between a Commodity and a Security or Asset? Commodities are physical products that are meant to be consumed or used in the production process. Assets, on the other hand, are goods that are not consumed through their use. For instance, money or a piece of machinery are used for productive purposes, but persist as they are used. A security is a financial instrument that is not a physical product. It is a legal representation e.g., a contract or claim that represents certain cash flows generated from various activities such as a stock representing the future cash flows of a business. What Are the Types of Commodities? Hard commodities are usually classified as those that are mined or extracted from the earth. These can include metals, ore, and petroleum energy products. Soft commodities instead refer to those that are grown, such as agricultural products. These include wheat, cotton, coffee, sugar, soybeans, and other harvested items. Where Are Commodities Traded? The major U.S. commodity exchanges are ICE Futures U.S. and the CME Group, which operate four major exchanges the Chicago Board of Trade CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME, the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX, and the Commodity Exchange, Inc. COMEX. There are also major commodities exchanges located around the world. The Bottom Line Commodities are basic goods and materials that are widely used and are not meaningfully differentiated from one another. Examples of commodities include barrels of oils, bushels of wheat, or megawatt-hours of electricity. Commodities have long been an important part of commerce, but in recent decades, commodities trading has become increasingly standardized.",

    "text": "Definition Forex is short for foreign exchange, which refers to the market in world currencies. Forex, a portmanteau of foreign and exchange, is where banks, businesses, governments, investors, and individuals buy or sell currencies. Whenever you purchase something in another currency or exchange cash to get the local money of your vacation destination, youre taking part in the forex or foreign exchange FX market . Businesses and individuals often do this while investors trade currencies to profit from fluctuating exchange rates . Forex is the largest and most liquid market in the world. Participants in this global electronic marketplace traded about 7.5 trillion per day in 2022, far exceeding the daily trading volumes of the world stock market. Key Takeaways Forex is the largest financial market, operating 24 hours a day during weekdays across major financial centers. Currencies are traded in pairs, with pricing influenced by various economic factors. Different types of forex trades include spot, forward, and futures contracts. Trading forex involves choosing a broker, understanding leverage, and executing trades. Forex trading carries risks such as leverage and market volatility, but also offers liquidity and flexibility. Investopedia Mira Norian What Is Forex? Forex is an over-the-counter OTC market. There is no single centralized exchange like there is with stocks. Transactions are made over computer networks that connect traders all over the world. Currencies move among traders, often with the support of a broker. Since its done electronically, there is typically no physical exchange of actual currencies. The main markets are open 24 hours a day, five days a week, beginning Sunday at 5 p.m. ET and ending Friday at 5 p.m. ET. What happens during these sessions determines the value of the worlds currencies or how much of x currency will buy how much of y currency. Currency prices, or exchange rates, are determined by supply and demand , or, more specifically, the demand for one currency compared with another. The factors that affect demand for a currency include a countrys economic growth, inflation, interest rates set by central banks, and political stability. Types of Forex Markets The chart above includes information on the size of different types of forex markets. Spot The spot market is where currencies are exchanged between buyers and sellers at the current exchange rate. Forward The forward forex market is an OTC market where two parties agree to trade a currency for a set price and quantity at a specified future date. These agreements are privately negotiated between the buyer and seller. Futures Futures markets function like forward markets but use centralized exchanges, which protect traders against counterparty risk, and offer standardized agreements rather than customizable ones. Options Forex options give participants the right, but not the obligation, to trade currencies at a given price and date in the future. These products trade OTC, with traders able to choose prices and expiration dates that suit them. Key Participants in the Forex Market In the past, big companies, governments, and hedge funds dominated the foreign exchange market. Today, currency trading is much easier for retail investors. Here are the major players in the market Commercial banks Banks provide a lot of liquidity and are the backbone of the forex market. They trade to hedge and speculate on behalf of their clients. Corporations Any company doing business overseas engages in the forex market, often daily. Central banks Central banks are in charge of managing a countrys economy and money supply. Part of that involves altering how the national currency is valued. Hedge funds Many hedge funds speculate on future exchange rates. There are even specific funds dedicated to currency. Money transfer companies Over the past decade or so, alternative companies in the business of exchanging currencies have emerged. Many offer more competitive exchange rates than banks, helping them tap into the large market of foreign workers earning in different currencies and sending money back home. Currency Pairs and Pricing In the forex market, currencies are traded in pairs . That means when you buy one currency you are simultaneously selling another oneand vice versa. For each currency pair, there is an exchange rate, indicating how much of the quote currency is needed to buy one unit of the base currency . For example, one of the most popular currency pairs is EURUSD , which is short for the euro and U.S. dollar. If the exchange rate for this currency pair is 1.10, it means one euro can be exchanged for 1.10 U.S. dollars. XE.com is one of the most popular places to obtain live exchange rates. If you use its platform, youll be given the option to input an amount in a selected currency and convert it to another currency at the current exchange rate. How To Trade Forex How you trade forex depends a lot on your familiarity with currencies and trading. Heres how a beginner can get started in steps Learn about forex and trading strategies . Before placing any trades, you need to learn how it all works. This includes familiarizing yourself with the terminology and factors that influence forex prices as well as trading strategies and how things like leverage, stop-loss orders, futures, and options work. The more you know about the tools at your disposal, the better you can use them to your advantage. Set up a brokerage account . Now you need to find a platform to trade on. Dont choose the first broker you come across. Select one thats regulated, has low fees, and has good reviews . Youll need to decide if you want to focus more on price or features. Decent customer support, user-friendly platforms, and access to basic tools should be minimum requirements. Practice with a demo account . Most platforms let you practice before trading with real money. Its worth taking them up on this option, at least to familiarize yourself with how the platform works, test out strategies, and discover how it feels trading in real time. Decide on a currency pair and trade . Now its time to trade with real money. Identify a currency pair you think could be profitable and start out slowly, using stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk and protect your gains. Example of a Forex Trade Lets say you think the U.S. dollar will strengthen in value against the euro. Suppose the USDEUR is trading at 0.90, meaning one U.S. dollar is worth 0.90 euros, and you think it could soon reach parity, meaning one U.S. dollar would buy one euro. Your rationale is based on studying recent moves in the market and EU-American trade discussions over tariffs . Based on this conviction, you exchange 900 euros for 1,000. Later, the exchange rate changes to 0.98, meaning one dollar now buys 0.98 euros. If you were to cash in at that moment and exit the trade, you would walk away with 980 euros, minus fees, representing an 80 profit. Lets assume you stayed in the trade, and the tables turned. After a few more weeks, the euro surged against the dollar, pushing the exchange rate all the way down to 0.85. Now, your original 900 euros would be worth 850 euros, which is a loss, even without factoring in trading fees. Risks and Benefits of Forex Trading Like any investing market, forex trading offers both risks and benefits. Some of the biggest draws are its long opening hours, high liquidity, and all-around accessibility. With forex trading, its possible to invest even small amounts and use leverage borrow to augment your trades, and transaction costs are generally low. Risks include how easy it is to use leverage and engage in complex trades in a market known for its volatility. The fact the forex market is decentralized, with no central exchange guaranteeing a trade, adds to this danger. Forex offers a lot more flexibility. But that comes at the cost of less regulation. The Bottom Line The forex market is used not just to exchange currencies but also to speculate on their future directions, including through futures and options contracts and by using leverage. Today, many retail investors trade through online brokers . The forex market is known for its accessibility, with low fees, high liquidity, and low minimum investment requirements. However, its also extremely volatile and can be risky for novices and experts alike.",

    "text": "Definition Dividends are periodic payments made to shareholders from corporate profits. What Are Dividends? Dividends are a percentage of a companys earnings paid to its shareholders as their share of the profits. Dividends are generally paid quarterly, with the amount decided by the board of directors based on the companys most recent earnings. Dividends may be paid in cash or additional shares. When a company announces a dividend, it also announces the payment date on which the dividend will be paid into the shareholders accounts. Key Takeaways A dividend is a distribution of a companys earnings to eligible shareholders. Dividend payments and amounts are determined by the companys board of directors. Many companies do not pay dividends and instead retain their earnings to be invested back into the company. Investopedia Julie Bang Understanding Dividends A dividend is a reward paid to the shareholders for their investment in a company, and it is usually paid out of the companys net profits. Some companies continue to make dividend payments even when their profits dont justify the expense. A steady track record of paying dividends makes stocks more attractive to investors. Various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ETFs also pay dividends. Dividends for stocks must be approved by shareholders for funds, the fund managers award dividends based on the funds net asset value and whether the fund receives dividends. Although cash dividends are common, dividends can also be issued as shares of stock. Fast Fact A stocks dividend yield is the dividend paid per share and is expressed as a percentage of the companys share price, such as 2.5. Who Gets Dividends and How Common stock shareholders of dividend-paying companies are eligible to receive a distribution as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date . This is essentially a cutoff date for assigning the dividend payment when shares change hands. Dividends are paid on a schedule set by the board. They may be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. For example, Walmart Inc. WMT and Unilever UL make regular quarterly dividend payments. Companies can also issue non-recurring special dividends, either individually or in addition to a scheduled dividend. For example, United Bancorp Inc. declared a 0.15 per share special dividend on Feb. 23, 2023. Fast Fact Not all companies pay dividends to the owners of common shares, but owners of preferred shares are guaranteed a set dividend payment. Dividend-Paying Companies Larger, established companies with predictable profits are often the best dividend payers. Companies within the following industry sectors maintain a regular record of dividend payments Basic materials Oil and gas Banks and financial Healthcare and pharmaceuticals Utilities Companies structured as master limited partnerships MLPs and real estate investment trusts REITS are required to make specified distributions to their shareholders. Funds may also issue regular dividend payments as stated in their investment objectives. Who Doesnt Pay a Dividend? Young, fast-growing companies such as those in the technology and biotechnology sectors may not pay regular dividends since they may be in the early stages of development and retain all of their earnings for research and development, business expansion, and operational activities. Investors tend to forgive the lack of a dividend if the companys stock price is growing rapidly. Not surprisingly, once a company begins paying dividends, it finds it difficult to reduce or suspend the payments. This is generally viewed by investors as a sign of falling profits, not to mention a loss of income. Important Dividend Dates Dividend payments follow a chronological order of events, and the associated dates are important in determining which shareholders qualify to receive the dividend payment Announcement date Dividends are announced by company management on the announcement date or declaration date and must be approved by the shareholders before they can be paid. Ex-dividend date The date on which the dividend eligibility expires is called the ex-dividend date or simply the ex-date. For instance, if a stock has an ex-date of Monday, May 5, shareholders who buy the stock on or after that day will NOT qualify to receive the dividend. Shareholders who own the stock one business day prior to the ex-date, on Friday, May 2, or earlier, qualify for the distribution. Record date The record date is the cutoff date, established by the company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution. Payment date The company issues the dividend payment on the payment date , which is when the money is credited to investors accounts. How Do Dividends Affect a Stocks Share Price? A stocks share price may change to reflect a dividend payment. For example, assume a company trading at 60 per share declares a 2 dividend. As the news becomes public, the share price may increase by 2 and hit 62. The stock might trade at 63 one business day before the ex-dividend date. On the ex-dividend date, its price will likely fall below its previous price, such as 61, at the start of the trading session, because anyone buying on the ex-dividend date will not receive the dividend. Why Do Companies Pay Dividends? Many investors buy stocks for their dividends rather than their share price growth potential. Some extraordinarily successful companies like Coca-Cola Co. are prized more by investors for their steady dividends than for their potential price growth. Dividends are often expected by shareholders as their share of the companys profits. Dividend payments reflect positively on a company and help maintain investors trust. A high-value dividend declaration can indicate that a company is doing well and has generated good profits. However, some may interpret it as an indication that the company does not have much going on in the way of new projects to generate better returns in the future. The company may appear to be using its cash to pay shareholders instead of reinvesting it into growth. A company with a long history of dividend payments that declares a reduction or elimination of its dividend signals trouble. However, a dividend cut does not necessarily translate into bad news. The companys management may have a plan for investing the money in a high-return project that could magnify returns for shareholders in the long run. Mutual Fund Dividends Dividends paid by funds are different from dividends paid by companies. Funds employ the principle of net asset value NAV, which reflects the valuation of their holdings or the price of the assets a fund has in its portfolio. Regular dividend payments should not be misread as a stellar performance by the fund. For example, a bond-investing fund may pay monthly dividends because it receives monthly interest on its interest-bearing holdings and merely transfers the income from the interest fully or partially to the funds investors. A stock-investing fund pays dividends from the earnings received from the many stocks held in its portfolio, or by selling a certain share of stocks and distributing capital gains. Are Dividends Irrelevant? Economists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani argued that a companys dividend policy is irrelevant and has no effect on its stock price or cost of capital . A shareholder may be indifferent to a companys dividend policy, especially if the dividend is used to buy more shares. If a dividend payout is seen as inadequate, an investor can sell shares to generate cash. In either case, the combination of the value of an investment in the company and the cash they hold will remain the same. Miller and Modigliani thus conclude that dividends are irrelevant, and investors shouldnt care about the firms dividend policy because they can create their own synthetically. This argument has done little to persuade the many investors who consider dividends an attractive investment incentive. How to Buy Dividend-Paying Investments Investors seeking dividend investments have several options, including stocks, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds ETFs. The dividend discount or Gordon growth models can help investors choose individual stocks. These techniques rely on anticipated future dividend streams to value shares. To compare multiple stocks based on their dividend payment performance, investors can use the dividend yield factor, which measures the dividend in terms of a percentage of the current market price of the companys share. How to Measure Dividends The dividend rate can be quoted in terms of the dollar amount each share receives as dividends per share DPS. In addition to dividend yield, another important performance measure to assess the returns generated from a particular investment is the total return factor. This figure accounts for interest, dividends, and increases in share price, among other capital gains. Tax is another important consideration when investing in dividend gains. Investors in high tax brackets often prefer dividend-paying stocks if their jurisdiction allows zero or comparatively lower tax on dividends. For example, Greece and Slovakia have a lower tax on dividend income for shareholders, while dividend gains are tax-exempt in Hong Kong. What Is a Dividend in Business? Dividends are business profits shared with and divided between investors. What Is an Example of a Dividend? A companys board of directors may decide to issue an annual 5 dividend per share. If the companys shares are worth 100, the dividend is 5. If the dividends are issued every quarter, each distribution is 1.25. Are Dividends Free Money? Dividends signal that a company has stable cash flow and is generating enough profits to provide investors with income. Because you need to purchase a stock or fund that pays dividends, and dividends are subject to taxes, they arent free. The Bottom Line Dividends are seen by many investors as a sign that a company is earning a healthy profit and, more to the point, is willing to share it with its investors. Not all companies pay dividends, and not all investors care about them. If you do, look for the best dividend-paying stocks for your money.",

    "text": "Definition A financial portfolio is a basket made up of positions in various investments that work together to serve an investors goals. What Is a Financial Portfolio? A portfolio is a collection of financial investments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents including closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds ETFs. People generally believe that stocks, bonds, and cash create the core of a portfolio. This is often the case but it doesnt have to be the rule. A portfolio can contain a wide range of assets including real estate, art, and private investments. You might choose to hold and manage your portfolio yourself or you may allow a money manager, financial advisor, or another finance professional to manage your portfolio for you. Key Takeaways A portfolio is a collection of financial investments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents as well as their fund counterparts. Stocks and bonds are generally considered to be a portfolios core building blocks but you can grow a portfolio with many types of assets including real estate, gold, paintings, and other art collectibles. Diversification is a key concept in portfolio management. A persons tolerance for risk, their investment objectives, and their time horizon are all critical factors when assembling and adjusting an investment portfolio. Portfolio management is an important financial skill for active investing. How Financial Portfolios Work One of the key concepts in portfolio management is the wisdom of diversification not putting all your eggs in one basket. Diversification tries to reduce risk by allocating investments among various financial instruments, industries, and other categories. It aims to maximize returns by investing in different areas that would each react differently to the same event. There are many ways to diversify. How you choose to do it is up to you. Your goals for the future, your appetite for risk, and your personality are all key factors in deciding how to build your portfolio. All portfolios should contain some degree of diversification, regardless of your portfolios asset mix. They should reflect the investors tolerance for risk, return objectives, time horizon , and other pertinent constraints. These can include tax position, liquidity needs, legal situations, and unique circumstances. Fast Fact Portfolio comes from the Latin word folium. It means to carry leaves as in papers. Stock and bond certificates were once issued only in paper form. Managing a Portfolio Think of an investment portfolio as a pie thats been divided into pieces of varying wedge-shaped sizes, each piece representing a different asset class and type of investment. Investors aim to construct a well-diversified portfolio to achieve a risk-return portfolio allocation thats appropriate for their level of risk tolerance. Stocks, bonds, and cash are generally viewed as a portfolios core building blocks but you can grow a portfolio with many types of assets including real estate, gold stocks , various types of bonds, paintings, and other art collectibles . Carla Tardi Investopedia This sample portfolio allocation is for an investor with a low tolerance for risk. A conservative strategy generally tries to protect a portfolios value by investing in lower-risk securities. Youll see in this example that a full 50 is allocated to bonds that might contain high-grade corporates and government bonds including municipals munis . The 20 stock allocation could be made up of blue-chip or large-cap equities and 30 of short-term investments might include cash, certificates of deposit CDs, and high-yield savings accounts. Important Most investment professionals agree that diversification is a key component for reaching long-range financial goals while minimizing risk although it doesnt guarantee against loss. Types of Portfolios There can be as many types of portfolios and portfolio strategies as there are investors and money managers. You might also choose to have multiple portfolios whose contents could reflect a different strategy or investment scenario structured for a different need. The Hybrid Portfolio Approach The hybrid portfolio approach diversifies across asset classes . Building a hybrid portfolio requires taking positions in stocks as well as bonds, commodities, real estate, and even art. A hybrid portfolio generally entails relatively fixed proportions of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. This is beneficial because stocks, bonds, and alternatives have historically exhibited less-than-perfect correlations with one another. Portfolio Investment You expect that the stock, bond, or another financial asset will earn a return, grow in value over time, or both when you use a portfolio for investment purposes. A portfolio investment may be either strategic where you buy financial assets with the intention of holding onto those assets for a long time or tactical where you actively buy and sell the asset hoping to achieve short-term gains. Aggressive Equities-focused Portfolio The underlying assets in an aggressive portfolio generally assume great risks in search of great returns. Aggressive investors seek companies that are in the early stages of their growth and have a unique value proposition . Most of them arent yet common household names. Defensive Equities-focused Portfolio A defensive portfolio would tend to focus on consumer staples that are impervious to downturns. Defensive stocks do well in bad times as well as in good times. Companies that make products that are essential to everyday life will survive no matter how bad the economy is at a given time. Income-focused Equities Portfolio This type of portfolio makes money from dividend-paying stocks or other types of distributions to stakeholders. Some of the stocks in the income portfolio could also fit in the defensive portfolio but theyre selected primarily for their high yields in this case. An income portfolio should generate positive cash flow. Real estate investment trusts REITs are an example of an income-producing investment. Speculative Equities-focused Portfolio A speculative portfolio is best for investors who have a high tolerance for risk. Speculative plays could include initial public offerings IPOs or stocks that are rumored to be takeover targets. Technology or healthcare firms in the process of developing a single breakthrough product would also fall into this category. Impact of Risk Tolerance on Portfolio Allocations A financial advisor can create a generic portfolio model for an individual but an investors risk tolerance should significantly reflect the portfolios content. Time Horizon and Portfolio Allocation Investors should also consider how long they have to invest when theyre building a portfolio. Investors should generally move toward a conservative asset allocation as their goal date approaches to protect the portfolios earnings up to that point. A conservative investor might favor a portfolio with large-cap value stocks, broad-based market index funds, investment-grade bonds, and a position in liquid, high-grade cash equivalents. Take an investor whos saving for retirement and plans to leave the workforce in five years. They might want to invest a larger portion of the portfolio in more conservative assets such as bonds and cash to help protect what has already been saved even if theyre comfortable investing in stocks and riskier securities. An individual whos just entering the workforce might want to invest their entire portfolio in stocks because they have decades to invest and the ability to ride out some of the markets short-term volatility . How Do You Create a Financial Portfolio? Building an investment portfolio requires more effort than the passive, index-investing approach. You must first identify your goals , risk tolerance, and time horizon then research and select stocks or other investments that fit within those parameters. Regular monitoring and updating are often required along with entry and exit points for each position. Rebalancing requires selling some holdings and buying more of others so your portfolios asset allocation matches your strategy, risk tolerance, and desired level of returns most of the time. Defining and building a portfolio can increase your investing confidence and give you control over your finances despite the extra effort required. What Does a Good Portfolio Look Like? A good portfolio will depend on your investment style, goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A good degree of diversification is generally recommended regardless of the portfolio type so youre not holding all your eggs in one basket. How Do You Measure a Portfolios Risk? A portfolios standard deviation of returns or variance is often used as a proxy of overall portfolio risk. The standard deviation calculation isnt merely a weighted average of the individual assets standard deviations. It must also account for the co-variance among the different holdings. The standard deviation calculation for a two-asset portfolio is σ p w 1 2 σ 1 2 w 2 2 σ 2 2 2w 1 w 2 Cov 1,2 12 The Bottom Line A portfolio is the cornerstone of investing in the markets. Its composed of the various positions in stocks, bonds, and other assets held and is viewed as one cohesive unit. The portfolio components must therefore work together to serve the investors financial goals, constrained by their risk tolerance and time horizon. Portfolios can be constructed to achieve various strategies, from index replication to income generation to capital preservation. Diversification is seen as a good way to reduce risk regardless of the strategy without sacrificing the portfolios expected return.

    "text": "Definition Risk, in financial terms, is the chance that an outcome or an investments actual gains will differ from an expected outcome, usually leaving one worse off. What Is Risk? In finance, risk refers to the possibility that the actual results of an investment or decision may turn out differently, often less favorably, than what was originally anticipated. Risk includes the possibility of losing some or all of an original investment. Quantifiably, risk is usually assessed by considering historical behaviors and outcomes. In finance, standard deviation is a common metric associated with risk. Standard deviation provides a measure of the volatility of asset prices in comparison to their historical averages in a given time frame. Overall, it is possible and prudent to manage investment risks by understanding the basics of risk and how it is measured. Learning the risks that can apply to different scenarios and some of the ways to manage them holistically will help all types of investors and business managers to avoid unnecessary and costly losses. Key Takeaways Risk takes on many forms but is broadly categorized as the chance that an outcome or investments actual gain will differ from the intended result or return. Risk includes the possibility of losing some or all of an investment. There are several types of risk and several ways to quantify risk for analytical assessments. Risk can be reduced using diversification and hedging strategies. Investopedia Mira Norian The Basics of Risk Everyone is exposed to some type of risk every daywhether its from driving, walking down the street, investing, capital planning, or something else. An investors personality , lifestyle, and age are some of the top factors to consider for individual investment management and risk purposes. Each investor has a unique risk profile that determines their willingness and ability to withstand risk. In general, as investment risks rise , investors expect higher returns to compensate for taking those risks. A fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return. The greater the amount of risk an investor is willing to take, the greater the potential return. Risks can come in various ways, and investors need to be compensated for taking on additional risk. For example, a U.S. Treasury bond is considered one of the safest investments and, when compared to a corporate bond , provides a lower rate of return. A corporation is much more likely to go bankrupt than the U.S. government. Because the default risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a higher rate of return. Quantifiably, the risk is usually assessed by considering historical behaviors and outcomes. In finance, standard deviation is a common metric associated with risk. Standard deviation provides a measure of the volatility of a value in comparison to its historical average. A high standard deviation indicates a lot of value volatility and therefore a high degree of risk. Individuals, financial advisors, and companies can all develop risk management strategies to help manage risks associated with their investments and business activities. Academically, there are several theories, metrics, and strategies that have been identified to measure, analyze, and manage risks. Some of these include standard deviation, beta, Value at Risk VaR, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM. Measuring and quantifying risk often allows investors, traders, and business managers to hedge some risks away by using various strategies, including diversification and derivative positions. Riskless Securities While it is true that no investment is fully free of all possible risks, certain securities have so little practical risk that they are considered risk-free or riskless. Riskless securities often form a baseline for analyzing and measuring risk. These types of investments offer an expected rate of return with very little or no risk. Oftentimes, all types of investors will look to these securities for preserving emergency savings or for holding assets that need to be immediately accessible. Examples of riskless investments and securities include certificates of deposits CDs , government money market accounts, and U.S. Treasury bills. The 30-day U.S. Treasury bill is generally viewed as the baseline, risk-free security for financial modeling. It is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and, given its relatively short maturity date, has minimal interest rate exposure. Important While savings accounts and CDs are riskless in the sense that their value cannot go down, bank failures can result in losses. The FDIC only insures up to 250,000 per depositor per bank, so any amount above that limit is exposed to the risk of bank failure. Warning While U.S. government bonds are often cited as riskless, investors can lose money if the government defaults on its debt. The U.S. came close to defaulting on its debt in 2011, when a political standoff over the debt ceiling led to a downgrade of its credit rating by Standard Poors. The episode caused significant volatility and uncertainty in financial markets and reduced economic growth. A looming default in 2023 would likely be worse, given the higher level of overall debt and the more polarized political environment. Risk and Time Horizons Time horizon and liquidity of investments are often key factors influencing risk assessment and risk management. If an investor needs funds to be immediately accessible, they are less likely to invest in high-risk investments or investments that cannot be immediately liquidated and more likely to place their money in riskless securities. Time horizons will also be an important factor for individual investment portfolios. Younger investors with longer time horizons to retirement may be willing to invest in higher-risk investments with higher potential returns. Older investors would have a different risk tolerance since they will need funds to be more readily available. Types of Financial Risk Every saving and investment action involves different risks and returns. In general, financial theory classifies investment risks affecting asset values into two categories systematic risk and unsystematic risk . Broadly speaking, investors are exposed to both systematic and unsystematic risks. Systematic risks, also known as market risks, are risks that can affect an entire economic market overall or a large percentage of the total market. Market risk is the risk of losing investments due to factors, such as political risk and macroeconomic risk, that affect the performance of the overall market. Market risk cannot be easily mitigated through portfolio diversification. Other common types of systematic risk can include interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, country risk, and sociopolitical risk. Unsystematic risk, also known as specific risk or idiosyncratic risk, is a category of risk that only affects an industry or a particular company. Unsystematic risk is the risk of losing an investment due to company or industry-specific hazards. Examples include a change in management, a product recall, a regulatory change that could drive down company sales, and a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take away market share from a company. Investors often use diversification to manage unsystematic risk by investing in a variety of assets. In addition to the broad systematic and unsystematic risks, there are several specific types of risk, including Business Risk Business risk refers to the basic viability of a businessthe question of whether a company will be able to make sufficient sales and generate sufficient revenues to cover its operational expenses and turn a profit. While financial risk is concerned with the costs of financing , business risk is concerned with all the other expenses a business must cover to remain operational and functioning. These expenses include salaries, production costs, facility rent, office, and administrative expenses. The level of a companys business risk is influenced by factors such as the cost of goods, profit margins, competition, and the overall level of demand for the products or services that it sells. Operational risk is a type of business risk that arises from the day-to-day operation of a business and can include risks associated with system failures, human errors, fraud, or other internal processes that might negatively impact a businesss financial performance. Operational risks can be managed through effective internal controls, processes, and systems. Businesses and investments can also be exposed to legal risks stemming from changes in laws, regulations, or legal disputes. Legal and regulatory risks can be managed through compliance programs, monitoring changes in regulations, and seeking legal advice as needed. Credit or Default Risk Credit risk is the risk that a borrower will be unable to pay the contractual interest or principal on its debt obligations. This type of risk is particularly concerning to investors who hold bonds in their portfolios. Government bonds , especially those issued by the federal government, have the least amount of default risk and, as such, the lowest returns. Corporate bonds, on the other hand, tend to have the highest amount of default risk, but also higher interest rates. Bonds with a lower chance of default are considered investment grade , while bonds with higher chances are considered high yield or junk bonds . Investors can use bond rating agencies such as Standard and Poors, Fitch, and Moodysto determine which bonds are investment-grade and which are junk. Country Risk Country risk refers to the risk that a country wont be able to honor its financial commitments. When a country defaults on its obligations, it can harm the performance of all other financial instruments in that country, as well as other countries it has relations. Country risk applies to stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, and futures that are issued within a particular country. This type of risk is most often seen in emerging markets or countries that have a severe deficit. Foreign-Exchange Risk When investing in foreign countries, its important to consider the fact that currency exchange rates can change the price of the asset as well. Foreign exchange risk or exchange rate risk applies to all financial instruments that are in a currency other than your domestic currency. As an example, if you live in the U.S. and invest in a Canadian stock in Canadian dollars, even if the share value appreciates, you may lose money if the Canadian dollar depreciates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that an investments value will change due to a change in the absolute level of interest rates, the spread between two rates, the shape of the yield curve, or any other interest rate relationship. This type of risk affects the value of bonds more directly than stocks and is a significant risk to all bondholders. As interest rates rise, bond prices in the secondary market falland vice versa. Reinvestment risk is related to interest rate risk. It is the possibility that an investor may not be able to reinvest the cash flows received from an investment such as interest or dividends at the same rate of return as the original investment. Reinvestment risk is particularly relevant for fixed income investments like bonds, where interest rates may change over time. Investors can manage reinvestment risk by laddering their investments, diversifying their portfolio, or considering investments with different maturity dates. Political Risk Political risk is the risk that an investments returns could suffer because of political instability or changes in a country. This type of risk can stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policy makers, or military control. Also known as geopolitical risk, the risk becomes more of a factor as an investments time horizon gets longer. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk is the likelihood or probability that one of those involved in a transaction might default on its contractual obligation . Counterparty risk can exist in credit, investment, and trading transactions, especially for those occurring in over-the-counter OTC markets. Financial investment products such as stocks, options, bonds, and derivatives carry counterparty risk. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is associated with an investors ability to transact their investment for cash. Typically, investors will require some premium for illiquid assets, which compensates them for holding securities over time that cannot be easily liquidated. Model Risk This type of risk arises from the use of financial models to make investment decisions, evaluate risks, or price financial instruments. Model risk can occur if the model is based on incorrect assumptions, data, or methodologies, leading to inaccurate predictions and potentially adverse financial consequences. Model risk can be managed by validating and periodically reviewing financial models, as well as using multiple models to cross-check predictions and outcomes. Risk vs. Reward The risk-return tradeoff is the balance between the desire for the lowest possible risk and the highest possible returns. In general, low levels of risk are associated with low potential returns, and high levels of risk are associated with high potential returns. Each investor must decide how much risk theyre willing and able to accept for a desired return. This will be based on factors such as age, income, investment goals, liquidity needs, time horizon, and personality. The following chart shows a visual representation of the riskreturn tradeoff for investing, where a higher standard deviation means a higher level of risk, as well as a higher potential return. Image by Sabrina Jiang Investopedia 2020 Its important to keep in mind that higher risk doesnt automatically equate to higher returns. The risk-return tradeoff only indicates that higher-risk investments have the possibility of higher returns, but there are no guarantees. On the lower-risk side of the spectrum is the risk-free rate of return the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. It represents the interest you would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specific period of time. In theory, the risk-free rate of return is the minimum return you would expect for any investment because you wouldnt accept additional risk unless the potential rate of return is greater than the risk-free rate. Risk and Diversification The most basicand effectivestrategy for minimizing risk is diversification . Diversification is based heavily on the concepts of correlation and risk. A well-diversified portfolio will consist of different types of securities from diverse industries that have varying degrees of risk and correlation with each others returns. While most investment professionals agree that diversification cant guarantee against a loss, it is the most important component to helping an investor reach long-range financial goals while minimizing risk. There are several ways to plan for and ensure adequate diversification, including Spread your portfolio among many different investment vehiclesincluding cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds , ETFs, and other funds. Look for assets whose returns havent historically moved in the same direction and to the same degree. That way, if part of your portfolio is declining, the rest may still be growing. Stay diversified within each type of investment. Include securities that vary by sector , industry , region, and market capitalization . Its also a good idea to mix styles, such as growth, income, and value. The same goes for bonds consider varying maturities and credit qualities. Include securities that vary in risk. Youre not restricted to picking only blue-chip stocks . In fact, the opposite is true. Picking different investments with different rates of return will ensure that large gains offset losses in other areas. Keep in mind that portfolio diversification is not a one-time task. Investors and businesses perform regular check-ups or rebalancing to make sure their portfolios have a risk level thats consistent with their financial strategy and goals. Can Portfolio Diversification Protect Against Risks? Portfolio diversification is an effective strategy used to manage unsystematic risks risks specific to individual companies or industries however, it cannot protect against systematic risks risks that affect the entire market or a large portion of it. Systematic risks, such as interest rate risk, inflation risk, and currency risk, cannot be eliminated through diversification alone. However, investors can still mitigate the impact of these risks by considering other strategies like hedging, investing in assets that are less correlated with the systematic risks, or adjusting the investment time horizon. How Does Investor Psychology Impact Risk-Taking and Investment Decisions? Investor psychology plays a significant role in risk-taking and investment decisions. Individual investors perception of risk, personal experiences, cognitive biases, and emotional reactions can influence their investment choices. For instance, behavioral economics identifies loss aversion, a cognitive bias where people are more sensitive to potential losses than gains, which can make investors overly cautious and avoid riskier investments that might offer higher potential returns. Understanding ones own psychological tendencies and biases can help investors make more informed and rational decisions about their risk tolerance and investment strategies. How Do Black Swan Events Relate to Risk Management, and How Can Investors Prepare for Them? Black swan events are rare, unpredictable, and high-impact occurrences that can have significant consequences on financial markets and investments. Due to their unexpected nature, traditional risk management models and strategies may not adequately account for these events. To prepare for black swan events, investors must understand their bias that things will remain the same and consider implementing stress testing, scenario analysis, or other techniques that focus on assessing the portfolios resilience under extreme market conditions. Additionally, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, holding adequate cash reserves, and being adaptable to evolving market conditions can help investors better navigate the potential fallout from black swan events. The Bottom Line We all face risks every daywhether were driving to work, surfing a 60-foot wave, investing, or managing a business. In the financial world, risk refers to the chance that an investments actual return will differ from what is expectedthe possibility that an investment wont do as well as youd like, or that youll end up losing money. The most effective way to manage investment risk is through regular risk assessment and diversification. Although diversification wont ensure gains or guarantee against losses, it does provide the potential to improve returns based on your goals and target level of risk. Finding the right balance between risk and return helps investors and business managers achieve their financial goals through investments that they can be most comfortable with.",

    "text": "Definition A return is the gains made or losses incurred on an investment. What Is a Return? A return, also known as a financial return, in its simplest terms, is the money made or lost on an investment over some period of time. A return can be expressed nominally as the change in dollar value of an investment over time. A return can also be expressed as a percentage derived from the ratio of profit to investment. Returns can also be presented as net results after fees, taxes, and inflation or gross returns that do not account for anything but the price change. It even includes a 401k investment. Key Takeaways A return is the change in price of an asset, investment, or project over time, which may be represented in terms of price change or percentage change. A positive return represents a profit, while a negative return marks a loss. Returns are often annualized for comparison purposes, while a holding period return calculates the gain or loss during the entire period that an investment was held. The real return accounts for the effects of inflation and other external factors, while the nominal return is only interested in price change. The total return for stocks includes price change as well as dividend and interest payments. Investopedia Julie Bang Understanding a Return Prudent investors know that a precise definition of return is situational and dependent on the financial data input to measure it. An omnibus term like profit could mean gross, operating, net, before tax, or after tax. An omnibus term like investment could mean selected, average, or total assets. A holding period return is an investments return over the time that it is owned by a particular investor. Holding period return may be expressed nominally or as a percentage. When expressed as a percentage, the term often used is rate of return RoR . For example, the return earned during the periodic interval of a month is a monthly return and of a year is an annual return. Often, people are interested in the annual return of an investment, or year-over-year YoY return, which calculates the price change from today to that of the same date one year ago. Returns over periodic intervals of different lengths can only be compared when they have been converted to same-length intervals. It is customary to compare returns earned during yearlong intervals. The process of converting shorter or longer return intervals to annual returns is called annualization . Nominal Return A nominal return is the net profit or loss of an investment expressed in the amount of dollars or other applicable currency before any adjustments for taxes, fees, dividends, inflation, or any other influence on the amount. It can be calculated by figuring the change in the value of the investment over a stated time period plus any distributions minus any outlays. Distributions received by an investor depend on the type of investment or venture but may include dividends , interest , rents, rights, benefits, or other cash flows received by an investor. Outlays paid by an investor depend on the type of investment or venture but may include taxes, costs, fees, or expenditures paid by an investor to acquire, maintain, and sell an investment. For example, assume an investor buys 1,000 worth of publicly traded stock, receives no distributions, pays no outlays, and sells the stock two years later for 1,200. The nominal return in dollars is 1,200 - 1,000 200. Fast Fact A positive return is the profit, or money made, on an investment or venture. Likewise, a negative return represents a loss, or money lost on an investment or venture. Real Return The real rate of return is adjusted for changes in prices due to inflation or other external factors. This method expresses the nominal rate of return in real terms, which keeps the purchasing power of a given level of capital constant over time. Adjusting the nominal return to compensate for factors such as inflation allows you to determine how much of your nominal return is real return. Knowing the real rate of return of an investment is very important before investing your money. Thats because inflation can reduce the value as time goes on, just as taxes also chip away at it. Investors should also consider whether the risk involved with a certain investment is something they can tolerate given the real rate of return. Expressing rates of return in real values rather than nominal values, particularly during periods of high inflation, offers a clearer picture of an investments value. Important The total return for a stock includes both capital gains and losses and dividend income, while the nominal return for a stock depicts only its price change. Return Ratios Return ratios are a subset of financial ratios that measure how effectively an investment is being managed. They help to evaluate if the highest possible return is being generated on an investment. In general, return ratios compare the tools available to generate profit, such as the investment in assets or equity to net income. Return ratios make this comparison by dividing selected or total assets or equity into net income. The result is a percentage of return per dollar invested that can be used to evaluate the strength of the investment by comparing it to benchmarks like the return ratios of similar investments, companies, industries, or markets. For instance, return of capital ROC means the recovery of the original investment. Return on Investment ROI A percentage return is a return expressed as a percentage. It is known as the return on investment ROI . ROI is the return per dollar invested. ROI is calculated by dividing the dollar return by the initial dollar investment. This ratio is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Assuming a 200 return on a 1,000 investment, the percentage return or ROI is 200 1,000 100 20. Return on Equity ROE Return on equity ROE is a profitability ratio calculated as net income divided by average shareholders equity that measures how much net income is generated per dollar of stock investment. If a company makes 10,000 in net income for the year and the average equity capital of the company over the same time period is 100,000, then the ROE is 10. Return on Assets ROA Return on assets ROA is a profitability ratio calculated as net income divided by average total assets that measures how much net profit is generated for each dollar invested in assets. It determines financial leverage and whether enough is earned from asset use to cover the cost of capital . Net income divided by average total assets equals ROA. For example, if net income for the year is 10,000, and total average assets for the company over the same time period is equal to 100,000, then the ROA is 10,000 divided by 100,000, or 10. Yield vs. Return Yield and return are sometimes used interchangeably in finance. However, depending on the context, they can also take on different meanings. In some such cases, yield is taken as a subset of return. Yield , in the context of fixed income, for example, is the income generated by an investment, usually expressed as a percentage of the investments price or face value . For instance, a bond with a face value of 1,000 and an annual coupon interest payment of 50 would have a yield of 5. Return, on the other hand, encompasses both the income generated by an investment and any capital gains or losses that result from changes in the investments market price . Pay attention to the context within which these terms are being used to understand whether they refer to the same thing or something slightly different. Is It Possible to have a Negative Return? Yes, negative returns are indicative of a loss, while positive returns show a gain. What Is Risk-return Tradeoff? Investors require a higher expected return for riskier investments to compensate for that additional risk of loss. This is why low-risk securities, such as government bonds, carry relatively lower expected returns than higher-risk securities like growth stocks. What are Gross Return and Net Return? Gross return is the absolute change in price plus any income paid by the investment over some period of time. Net return takes the gross return and subtracts any commissions, management and other fees, and taxes. In other words, net return is what you are able to actually pocket from the investment. The so-called real return additionally accounts for the effects of inflation. How Does Diversification Impact Returns? Investing in a variety of different securities can help diversify a portfolio and potentially achieve a higher return without adding much additional risk. By spreading out investments across different sectors and asset classes that are not highly correlated, investors can minimize the risk of any single security negatively impacting returns. Indeed, the math shows that proper diversification can reduce a portfolios volatility while maintaining or potentially increasing its expected return. The Bottom Line Return is the gain or loss that an investment generates over a period of time. A positive return indicates a profit, while a negative return indicates a loss. The return on an investment is usually quoted as a percentage and includes any income that the investment generates e.g., interest, dividends as well as capital gains price increases. To generate higher expected returns, investors usually need to take on more risk of potential losses.",

    "text": "Definition Volatility is a statistical measurement of the degree of variability of the return of a security or market index. What Is Volatility? Volatility is a measurement of how varied the returns of a given security or market index are over time. It is often measured from either the standard deviation or variance between those returns. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big price swings, either up or down. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than 1 over a sustained period of time, it is called a volatile market. An assets volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts. Key Takeaways Volatility represents how greatly an assets prices swing around the mean price. There are several ways to measure volatility, including beta coefficients, option pricing models, and standard deviation of returns. Volatile assets are often considered riskier than less volatile assets because the price is expected to be less predictable. Implied volatility measures how volatile the market will be, while historical volatility measures price changes over past time periods. Volatility is an important variable in the calculation of options prices. Understanding Volatility Volatility often refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk related to the size of changes in a securitys value. A higher volatility means that a securitys value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the security can move dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower volatility means that a securitys value does not fluctuate dramatically, and tends to be steadier. One way to measure an assets variation is to quantify the daily returns percent move on a daily basis of the asset. Historical volatility is based on historical prices and represents the degree of variability in the returns of an asset. This number is without a unit and is expressed as a percentage. While variance captures the dispersion of returns around the mean of an asset in general, volatility is a measure of that variance bounded by a specific time period. Thus, we can report daily, weekly, monthly, or annualized volatility. It is useful to think of volatility as the annualized standard deviation . How to Calculate Volatility Volatility is often calculated using variance and standard deviation the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Since volatility describes changes over a specific period of time, you simply take the standard deviation and multiply that by the square root of the number of periods in question Volatility σT where σ standard deviation of returns T number of periods in the time horizon Volatility and Stocks For simplicity, lets assume we have monthly stock closing prices of 1 through 10. For example, month one is 1, month two is 2, and so on. To calculate variance, follow the five steps below. Find the mean of the data set. This means adding each value and then dividing it by the number of values. If we add 1, plus 2, plus 3, all the way to up to 10, we get 55. This is divided by 10 because we have 10 numbers in our data set. This provides a mean, or average price, of 5.50. Calculate the difference between each data value and the mean. This is often called deviation. For example, we take 10 - 5.50 4.50, then 9 - 5.50 3.50. This continues all the way down to the first data value of 1. Negative numbers are allowed. Since we need each value, these calculations are frequently done in a spreadsheet. Square the deviations. This will eliminate negative values. Add the squared deviations together. In our example, this equals 82.5. Divide the sum of the squared deviations 82.5 by the number of data values. In this case, the resulting variance is 8.25. Next, take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation. This equals 2.87. This is a measure of risk and shows how values are spread out around the average price. It gives traders an idea of how far the price may deviate from the average. Sabrina Jiang Investopedia If prices are randomly sampled from a normal distribution , then about 68 of all data values will fall within one standard deviation. Ninety-five percent of data values will fall within two standard deviations 2 2.87 in our example, and 99.7 of all values will fall within three standard deviations 3 2.87. In this case, the values of 1 to 10 are not randomly distributed on a bell curve rather, they are uniformly distributed. Therefore, the expected 689599.7 percentages do not hold. Despite this limitation, traders frequently use standard deviation, as price returns data sets often resemble more of a normal bell curve distribution than in the given example. Tip The volatility of stock prices is thought to be mean-reverting , meaning that periods of high volatility are often moderate and periods of low volatility pick up, fluctuating around some long-term mean. Types of Volatility Implied Volatility Implied volatility IV , also known as projected volatility, is one of the most important metrics for options traders. As the name suggests, it allows them to make a determination of just how volatile the market will be going forward. This concept also gives traders a way to calculate probability. One important point to note is that it isnt considered science and therefore does not forecast how the market will move in the future. Unlike historical volatility, implied volatility comes from the price of an option itself and represents volatility expectations for the future. Because it is implied, traders cannot use past performance as an indicator of future performance. Instead, they have to estimate the potential of the option in the market. Fast Fact Implied volatility is a key feature of options trading. Historical Volatility Also referred to as statistical volatility, historical volatility HV gauges the fluctuations of underlying securities by measuring price changes over predetermined time periods. It is the less prevalent metric compared with implied volatility because it isnt forward-looking. When there is a rise in historical volatility, a securitys price will also move more than normal. At this time, there is an expectation that something will or has changed. If the historical volatility is dropping, on the other hand, it means any uncertainty has been eliminated, so things return to the way they were. This calculation may be based on intraday changes, but often measures movements based on the change from one closing price to the next. Depending on the intended duration of the options trade, historical volatility can be measured in increments ranging anywhere from 10 to 180 trading days. Volatility and Options Pricing Volatility is a key variable in options pricing models, estimating the extent to which the return of the underlying asset will fluctuate between now and the options expiration. Volatility, as expressed as a percentage coefficient within option-pricing formulas, arises from daily trading activities. How volatility is measured will affect the value of the coefficient used. Volatility is also used to price options contracts using models like the Black-Scholes or binomial tree models. More volatile underlying assets will translate to higher options premiums because with volatility, there is a greater probability that the options will end up in the money at expiration. Options traders try to predict an assets future volatility, so the price of an option in the market reflects its implied volatility. Important The greater the volatility, the higher the market price of options contracts across the board. Other Measures of Volatility Beta One measure of the relative volatility of a particular stock to the market is its beta β. A beta approximates the overall volatility of a securitys returns against the returns of a relevant benchmark usually, the SP 500 is used. For example, a stock with a beta value of 1.1 has moved 110 for every 100 move in the benchmark, based on price level . Conversely, a stock with a beta of 0.9 has moved 90 for every 100 move in the underlying index. The VIX Market volatility can also be seen through the Volatility Index VIX , a numeric measure of equity market volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange created the VIX as a measure to gauge the 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. stock market derived from real-time quote prices of SP 500 call and put options . It is effectively a gauge of future bets that investors and traders are making on the direction of the markets or individual securities. A high reading on the VIX implies a risky market. Traders can trade the VIX using a variety of options and exchange-traded products. Or they can use VIX values to price certain derivative products. Tips for Managing Volatility Investors can find periods of high volatility to be distressing, as prices can swing wildly or fall suddenly. Long-term investors are best advised to ignore periods of short-term volatility and stay the course. This is because over the long run, stock markets tend to rise. Meanwhile, emotions like fear and greedwhich can become amplified in volatile marketscan undermine your long-term strategy. Some investors can use volatility as an opportunity to add to their portfolios by buying the dips , when prices are relatively cheap. You can also use hedging strategies to navigate volatility, such as buying protective puts to limit downside losses without having to sell any shares. But note that put options will also become pricier when volatility is higher. Example of Volatility Suppose that an investor is building a retirement portfolio. Since she is retiring within the next few years, shes seeking stocks with low volatility and steady returns. She considers two companies ABC Corp. has a beta coefficient of 0.78, which makes it slightly less volatile than the SP 500 index. XYZ Inc. has a beta coefficient of 1.45, making it significantly more volatile than the SP 500 index. A more conservative investor may choose ABC Corp. for their portfolio , since it has less volatility and more predictable short-term value. What Is Volatility, Mathematically? Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of data around its mean over a certain period of time. It is calculated as the standard deviation multiplied by the square root of the number of time periods, T. In finance, it represents this dispersion of market prices, on an annualized basis. Is Volatility the Same As Risk? Volatility is often used to describe risk, but this is not necessarily always the case. Risk involves the chances of experiencing a loss, while volatility describes how much and quickly prices move. If increased price movements also increase the chance of losses, then risk is likewise increased. Is Volatility a Good Thing? Whether volatility is good or bad depends on what kind of trader you are and what your risk appetite is. For long-term investors, volatility can spell trouble, but for day traders and options traders, volatility often equals trading opportunities . What Does High Volatility Mean? If volatility is high, it means that prices are moving both up and down quickly and steeply. What Is the VIX? The VIX is the Cboe Volatility Index, a measure of the short-term volatility in the broader market, measured by the implied volatility of 30-day SP 500 options contracts. The VIX generally rises when stocks fall, and declines when stocks rise. Also known as the fear index, the VIX can be a gauge of market sentiment, with higher values indicating greater volatility and greater fear among investors. The Bottom Line Volatility is how much and how quickly prices move over a given span of time. In the stock market, increased volatility is often a sign of fear and uncertainty among investors. This is why the VIX volatility index is sometimes called the fear index. At the same time, volatility can create opportunities for day traders to enter and exit positions. Volatility is also a key component in options pricing and trading.",

    "text": "Definition A market is a place or venue that facilitates the exchange of goods and services. Markets can be physical or virtual. What Is a Market? A market is any place or venue where buyers and sellers can exchange goods and services. A market may be physical, like a retail outlet, or virtual, like an online brokerage with no physical contact between buyers and sellers. Some key characteristics of a market are the availability of an arena, buyers and sellers, and a commodity or other asset that can be bought and sold. Key Takeaways A market is a venue where buyers and sellers can meet to facilitate the exchange or transaction of goods and services. Markets can be physical, like a retail outlet, or virtual, like an e-retailer. Other examples include illegal markets, auction markets, and financial markets. The prices of goods and services in a market are determined by supply and demand. Features of a market include the availability of an arena, buyers and sellers, and commodities. Candra Huff Investopedia How Markets Work A market is anyplace where two or more parties can meet to engage in an economic transactioneven those that dont involve legal tender . A market transaction may include goods, services, information, currency, or any combination that passes from one party to another. In short, markets are any setting where buyers and sellers can gather and interact. Every trade needs at least two parties a buyer and a seller. In some cases, a third party is required to introduce competition and balance the market. As such, a market in a state of perfect competition , among other things, is characterized by a high number of active buyers and sellers. Beyond this broad definition, there are many types of markets, depending on what is being sold. For instance, it may refer to the stock market, which is the place where securities are traded. It may also describe a collection of people who wish to buy a specific product or service in a particular place, such as the Brooklyn housing market it could also refer to an industry or business sector, such as the global diamond market. Certain decisions that help shape the market are determined by an economic system known as the market economy . In this system, factors like investments and the production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services are led by supply and demand from businesses and individuals. As such, a market economy is unplanned and is not part of a planned or command economy , where the government dictates all of these factors. Examples of market economies include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Fast Fact The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulates the stock and bond markets in the United States. It puts provisions in place to prevent fraud while ensuring traders and investors have the right information to make the most informed decisions possible. Supply and Demand Whatever the context, a market establishes the prices for goods and other services. These rates are determined by supply and demand . The idea of supply and demand is one of the very basics of economics. The sellers create supply, while buyers generate demand. Markets try to find some balance in price when supply and demand are in balance. But that balance can be disrupted by factors other than price, including incomes , expectations, technology, the cost of production, and the number of buyers and sellers participating. Simply put, the number of goods and services available is determined by what people want and how eager they are to buy. Sellers increase production when buyers demand more goods and services. Producers tend to raise their prices when demand increases. When buyer demand decreases, they drop their prices and, therefore, the number of goods and services they bring to market. Physical and Virtual Markets Markets may be represented by physical locations where transactions are made. These include retail stores and similar businesses that sell individual items to wholesale markets selling goods to distributors. Or they may be virtual. Internet-based stores and auction sites such as Amazon and eBay are examples of markets where transactions can occur entirely online, and the parties involved never physically connect. Markets may emerge organically or as a means of enabling ownership rights over goods, services, and information. When on a national or more specific regional level, markets may often be categorized as developed or developing. This distinction depends on many factors, including income levels and the nation or regions openness to foreign trade . Important The size of a market is determined by the number of buyers and sellers and the amount of money that changes hands each year. Features of a Market Certain features help define a market and are necessary for it to function. The following are the most basic characteristics that shape a market Arena This is the platform where transactions are conducted between buyers and sellers. Keep in mind that this doesnt necessarily mean a physical location. Buyers and Sellers For the market to function, there must be buyers and sellers. The market cant exist if someone isnt buying something that someone else is selling. These entities can be businesses, individuals, or even governments, and they can execute their transactions physically or virtually, thanks to the internet. One Commodity A single market depends on a single commodity, so a related commodity must be present for a market to operate. For instance, wheat is the commodity bought and sold in the wheat market. Electronics make up the electronics market en masse, but they can be broken down into subcategories. Other features include competition, pricing, and the freedom to buy and sell goods and services. Types of Markets Markets vary widely for several reasons, including the kinds of products sold, location, duration, and size. The constituency of the customer base, size, legality, and other factors are equally influential. Aside from the two most common marketsphysical and virtualthere are other kinds of markets where parties can gather to execute their transactions. Underground Market An underground or black market refers to an illegal market where transactions occur without the knowledge of the government or other regulatory agencies. Many illegal markets exist to circumvent existing tax laws . This is why many involve cash-only transactions or non-traceable forms of currency, making them harder to track. Many illegal markets exist in economically developing countries with planned or command economies, where the government controls the production and distribution of goods and services. When there is a shortage of specific goods and services in the economy, members of the illegal market step in and fill the void. Illegal markets can also exist in developed economies. These shadow markets , as theyre also known, become prevalent when prices control the sale of specific products or services, especially when demand is high. Ticket scalping is one example of an illegal or shadow market. When demand for concert or theater tickets is high, scalpers will step in, buy a bunch, and sell them at inflated prices on the underground market. Fast Fact The term market doesnt need to refer to a specific place or venue. It can also be used abstractly to describe the changing availability of something in demandfor example, the jobs market or the housing market. Auction Market An auction market brings many people together for the sale and purchase of specific lots of goods. The buyers or bidders try to top each other for the purchase price. The items for sale go to the highest bidder. The most common auction markets involve livestock, foreclosed homes, and art and antiques. Many operate online now. For example, the U.S. Treasury sells its bonds, notes, and bills via regular auctions. Financial Market The blanket term financial market refers to anyplace where securities , currencies, and bonds are traded between two parties. These markets are the basis of capitalist societies , providing capital formation and liquidity for businesses. They can be physical or virtual. The financial market includes stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange NYSE, Nasdaq , the London Stock Exchange LSE , and the TMX Group . Other financial markets include the bond and foreign exchange markets, where people trade currencies. Regulating Markets Other than underground markets, most markets are subject to rules and regulations set by a governing body that determines the markets nature. This may be the case when the regulation is as wide-reaching and widely recognized as an international trade agreement or as local and temporary as a pop-up street market where vendors maintain order and rules among themselves. How Will I Use This in Real Life? Almost everyone will interact with markets in at least two important ways. First, as consumers, we typically buy items of value through some kind of market, whether a commercial supermarket, informal street markets, or a virtual marketplace like Amazon. In addition, if you work a job, you are participating in the labor market . Just like other goods, the price of your labor or salary is set by supply and demand, although it is also regulated by the government. When you buy or rent a home, you are participating in the housing market , and if you choose to save part of your income in a 401k retirement plan , it will be invested in the stock and bond markets . How Do Markets Work? Markets are arenas in which buyers and sellers can gather and interact. A high number of active buyers and sellers characterizes a market in a state of perfect competition. The market establishes the prices for goods and other services. These rates are determined by supply and demand. The sellers create supply, while buyers generate demand. Markets try to find some balance in price when supply and demand are in balance. What Is a Black Market? A black market refers to an illegal exchange or marketplace where transactions occur without the knowledge or oversight of officials or regulatory agencies. They tend to spring up when there is a shortage of specific goods and services in an economy or when supply and prices are state-controlled. Transactions tend to be undocumented and cash-only, all the better to be untraceable. How Are Markets Regulated? Most markets are subject to rules and regulations set by a regional or governing body that determines the markets nature. They can be international, national, or local authorities. The Bottom Line Markets are an important part of the economy. They allow a space where governments, businesses, and individuals can buy and sell their goods and services. But thats not all. They help determine the pricing of goods and services and inject much-needed liquidity into the economy. By offering a place to conduct transactions, markets allow entities access to the capital to further their interests, whether to fund infrastructure, fulfill growth plans, make purchases, or invest their money. This helps fuel innovation to secure a competitive edge in the marketplace.",

    "text": "What Is Technical Analysis? Technical analysis is a method of evaluating statistical trends in trading activity, typically involving price movement and volume. It is used to identify trading and investment opportunities. Unlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a securitys value based on financial information such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on price and volume to draw conclusions about future price movements. Key Takeaways Technical analysis is used to evaluate price trends and patterns and thereby identify potential investments and trading opportunities. Technical analysts believe past trading activity and a securitys price changes can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements. Technical analysis may be contrasted with fundamental analysis, which focuses on a companys financials rather than historical price patterns or stock trends. Technical analysis was introduced by Charles Dow. Investopedia Candra Huff Understanding Technical Analysis Technical analysis is used to scrutinize the ways supply and demand for a security affect changes in price, volume, and implied volatility. It assumes that past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements when paired with appropriate investing or trading rules. Technical analysis various charting tools are often used to generate short-term trading signals. They can also help improve the evaluation of a securitys strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its sectors. This information helps analysts improve their overall valuation estimate. Technical analysis as we know it today was first introduced by Charles Dow as the Dow Theory in the late 1800s. Several noteworthy researchers including William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson Gould, and John Magee further contributed to Dow Theory concepts. Nowadays, technical analysis has evolved to include hundreds of patterns and signals developed through years of research. How Technical Analysis Is Used Professional analysts often use technical analysis in conjunction with other forms of research. Retail traders may make decisions based solely on the price charts of a security and similar statistics. But practicing equity analysts rarely limit their research to fundamental or technical analysis alone. Technical analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data. This includes stocks, futures , commodities , fixed-income securities, currencies, and more. In fact, technical analysis is prevalent in commodities and forex markets where traders focus on short-term price movements. Technical analysis attempts to forecast the price movement of virtually any tradable instrument that is generally subject to forces of supply and demand. Some view technical analysis as simply the supply and demand forces reflected by the market price movements of a security. Technical analysis most commonly applies to price changes, but some analysts track numbers other than just price, such as trading volume or open interest figures. Technical Analysis Indicators Hundreds of patterns and signals have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading. Technical analysts have also developed numerous types of trading systems to help them forecast and trade on price movements. Some indicators focus primarily on identifying the current market trend, including support and resistance areas. Others focus on determining the strength of a trend and the likelihood of its continuation. Commonly used technical indicators and charting patterns include trendlines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators. In general, technical analysts look at the following broad types of indicators Price trends Chart patterns Volume and momentum indicators Oscillators Moving averages Support and resistance levels Fast Fact The CMT Association supports the largest collection of chartered or certified analysts using technical analysis professionally around the world. The associations Chartered Market Technician CMT designation can be obtained after three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical analysis tools. Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis Technical analysis attempts to decipher the market sentiment behind price trends by looking for price patterns and trends. Charles Dow released a series of editorials discussing technical analysis theory. He had two basic assumptions that continue to form the framework for technical analysis trading. Markets are efficient with values that represent factors that influence a securitys price. Even random market price movements appear to move in identifiable patterns and trends that tend to repeat over time. Today the field of technical analysis builds on Dows work. Professional analysts typically accept three general assumptions The market discounts everything Technical analysts believe that everything from a companys fundamentals to broad market factors to market psychology is already priced into a stock. The Efficient Markets Hypothesis EMH draws a similar conclusion about prices. The only thing remaining is the analysis of price movements, which technical analysts view as the product of supply and demand for a particular stock. Price moves in trends Technical analysts expect that prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. In other words, a stock price is more likely to continue a past trend than to move erratically. Most technical trading strategies are based on this assumption. History tends to repeat itself The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable and based on emotions such as fear and excitement. Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze these emotions and subsequent price movements to understand trends. While many forms of technical analysis have been used for more than 100 years, they are believed to be relevant still because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves. Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis Fundamental analysis and technical analysis, the major schools of thought when it comes to approaching the markets, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Both methods are used to research and forecast future trends in stock prices , and like any investment strategy or philosophy, both have their advocates and adversaries. Fundamental Analysis Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies. Earnings , expenses , assets, and liabilities are all important characteristics of fundamental analysis that help analysts determine the fair value of a business. Technical Analysis Technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis in that the stocks price and volume are the only inputs. The core assumption is that all publicly known fundamentals have factored into price thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a securitys intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that suggest how a stocks price will move in the future. Limitations of Technical Analysis 1. For some analysts and academic researchers, the EMH demonstrates why no actionable information is contained in historical price and volume data. However, by the same reasoning, nor should business fundamentals provide actionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and semi-strong form of the EMH. 2. Another criticism of technical analysis is that history does not repeat itself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be ignored. Prices seem to be better modeled as a random walk. 3. A third criticism of technical analysis is that it works in some cases but only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, many technical traders will place a stop-loss order below the 200-day moving average of a certain company. If a large number of traders have done so and the stock reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock price down, confirming the movement traders anticipated. Then, other traders will see the price decrease and sell their positions, reinforcing the strength of the trend. This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the assets price will be weeks or months from now. In sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal. However, over the long run, this sole group of traders cannot drive the price. What Assumptions Do Technical Analysts Make? Professional technical analysts typically assume three things. First, the market discounts everything. Second, prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. Third, history tends to repeat itself. The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable. Whats the Difference Between Fundamental and Technical Analysis? Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. The core assumption of technical analysis, on the other hand, is that all known fundamentals are factored into price thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a securitys intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that might suggest how the securitys price will move in the future. How Can I Learn Technical Analysis? Your first step is to learn about investing, stocks, markets, and financials. This can be done through books, online courses and materials, and in-person classes. Once you understand the basics, you can start studying technical analysis . The Bottom Line Technical analysis is a longstanding method of analyzing the price and volume data of securities to determine future price action. This data usually appears on charts. Investors and professional traders apply a variety of technical indicators to these price and volume charts to draw conclusions and make decisions about entry and exit points for trades.",

    "text": "Definition Fundamental analysis is a technique to measure a companys value based on its financials and other objective metrics, as opposed to market price trends. What Is Fundamental Analysis? Fundamental analysis involves examining a companys financial statements and broader economic indicators to uncover a securitys intrinsic value. The result of such an analysis should give you the investments true worth based on a companys financial health, the market, and economic conditions. Investors perform fundamental analysis to gauge whether or not to invest in a company based on its current and projected worth. Key Takeaways Fundamental analysis is a method of determining a stocks intrinsic value. Fundamental analysts search for stocks trading at prices higher or lower than their real value. Fundamental analysis is different from technical analysis, which studies historical price trends and market sentiment. Most analysts use a combination of fundamental and technical analysis. Investopedia Paige McLaughlin Understanding Fundamental Analysis Fundamental analysis looks at intrinsic factors to determine a companys value, as opposed to its current price or market trends. This approach looks beyond investor sentiment and company marketing to determine if the stock price is over- or undervalued. Fundamental analysis starts by examining the companys financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. Analysts look at the companys assets, debts, revenue, and other metrics, and compare them with other companies in the same industry. In addition, fundamental analysis also looks at macroeconomic factors to see if the company is positioned for success. Analysts may consider gross domestic product, inflation, interest rates, industry or sector trends, and the companys competition. This approach often includes reviewing the companys business model, management effectiveness, brand awareness, and potential for growth and profitability. Why Is Fundamental Analysis Important? Fundamentals allow investors to look beyond short-term price fluctuations and focus on the underlying factors that drive a companys operations and long-term performance. The main benefit of fundamental analysis is to help quantify the value of a company and its shares. Financial statements offer hard data that reveal insights into a companys profitability, liquidity , and overall financial stability. This information, along with an assessment of the companys management team, competitive advantages, and industry trends, furnishes an objective measure of the companys value. With this knowledge, investors can make more informed decisions about buying, holding, or selling a particular stock. Fundamental analysis can also help investors identify undervalued companies. By considering a companys sales growth, market share, and product pipeline, investors can gauge its ability to increase future profits and grow shareholder value. Value investors , in particular, look for undervalued shares relative to their fundamental potential. It can also help spot red flags and overvalued investments. By researching a companys financial health and market position, investors can determine if a company is likely to underperform or experience significant downturns. This is especially important during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility. Where to Find Fundamentals for a Company Some of the most common and reliable sources for the fundamentals of a company include the following Company filings Public companies are required to file regular reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, such as Form 10-K annual report, Form 10-Q quarterly report, and Form 8-K current events report. These filings contain detailed financial statements, management discussions and analyses, and other important information about the company. You can access these filings for free on the SECs EDGAR database. Company website Most publicly traded companies have an investor relations section that provides financial statements, earnings releases, investor presentations, and other relevant information for shareholders and potential investors. Earnings call transcripts can be particularly helpful since companies use them to address their soft spots for analysts. Financial platforms Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, and MarketWatch, among others, provide financial news, analysis, and fundamental data on publicly traded companies, including financial statements, key ratios, and analyst ratings. Broker research reports Many brokerage firms supply research reports on companies they and their affiliates cover, often with detailed fundamental analysis and investment recommendations. Financial data providers Subscription-based financial data providers such as Bloomberg, FactSet, and Morningstar offer extensive fundamental data and analysis on companies, industries, and markets. Subscriptions are often pricey, so they are more typically used by professional investors and analysts. Industry trade journals Trade publications covering specific industries can provide valuable insights on industry trends, competitive dynamics, and company-specific developments that inform your fundamental analysis. Remember, when conducting fundamental analysis, its essential to use several sources to get a well-rounded view of a companys financial prospects and to be aware of any potential biases or conflicts of interest in the information youre receiving. Fast Fact Fundamental analysis is used most often for stocks, but it can be useful for evaluating any security, from a bond to a derivative. If you consider the fundamentals, from the broader economy to the company details, you are doing a fundamental analysis. How to Read a Companys Annual Report Reading a companys annual report is an essential part of fundamental analysis. Heres a step-by-step guide on how to read and analyze an annual report Start with the CEOs letter to shareholders This section gives an overview of the companys performance, key developments, and outlook from the perspective of top management. Pay attention to the tone and content of the letter, as it can give insights into the companys strategy, challenges, and prospects. Review the business description This section describes the companys main products or services, target markets, competitive advantages, and key risks. It can help you understand the companys business model and the factors that drive its success. Analyze the managements discussion and analysis MDA The MDA provides a detailed discussion of the companys financial performance, including revenue and expense trends, cash flows, and key financial ratios. It also has managements perspective on the factors that affect the companys performance and outlook for the future. Examine the financial statements The annual report has the companys audited financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. Review these carefully while looking for trends in revenue, expenses, profits, assets, liabilities, and cash flows. From there, you can compute the critical financial ratios. Read the notes to the financial statements The notes or footnotes provide additional details and explanations about the companys accounting policies, significant transactions, and other important information that may not be clear from the financial statements alone. Review the auditors report This provides an independent opinion on whether the financial statements fairly present the companys financial position and performance following generally accepted accounting principles. Look for any qualified opinions or disclaimers that may indicate potential issues. Analyze the companys corporate governance The annual report often has information on the companys board of directors, executive compensation, and other corporate governance matters. Consider whether the companys governance practices align with the interests of shareholders and whether there are any red flags, such as conflicts of interest or excessive compensation. Look for additional disclosures The annual report may include additional disclosures about legal proceedings, regulatory issues, or environmental, social, and governance ESG factors that could impact the companys performance and reputation. A Closer Look at Financial Statements The information in financial statements is among the most valuable about a companys financial health and performance. Heres a breakdown of what you can learn from each one Income Statement This shows how much money a company is making revenue, how much theyre spending expenses, and whats left over profit or loss. By looking at trends in revenue and expenses over time, you can get a sense of whether the company is growing or struggling. You can also calculate important ratios like the companys profit margin, which tells you how much of each dollar in sales the company gets to keep as profit. Balance Sheet This gives you a snapshot of what a company owns assets, what it owes liabilities, and what is left over shareholders equity . This can help you assess a companys financial stability and liquidity. For example, if a company has a lot more assets than liabilities, thats generally a good sign. You can also look at how much debt the company has relative to its equity to understand its financial leverage and risk. Statement of Cash Flows This shows how much cash is coming in and going out of the company over a given period. Its broken down into three main categories cash from operations the money generated by the companys core business activities, cash from investing the money spent or earned from investments not related to the core business, and cash from financing the money raised or paid out and used to fund the business. By looking at a companys cash flows, you can better understand its ability to generate cash, pay its bills, and invest in growth. The cash flow statement is crucial because its harder for a business to manipulate its cash situation. An aggressive accountant can do plenty of things to manipulate earnings, for example, but its tough to fake cash in the bank. For this reason, some investors use the cash flow statement as a more conservative measure of a companys performance. Fast Fact A balance sheet gets its name because the three sections it containsassets, liabilities, and shareholders equitymust balance out using this formula Assets Liabilities Shareholders Equity Quantitative and Qualitative Fundamental Analysis The problem with defining the fundamentals is that they can cover anything related to a companys economic well-being. They can include numbers like revenue and profit, but they can also include anything from a companys market share to the quality of its management. Generally, these are grouped into two categories quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative information that can be shown using numbers, figures, ratios, or formulas Qualitative rather than a quantity of something, it is its quality, standard, or nature In this context, quantitative fundamentals are hard numbers, the measurable characteristics of a business. The most significant source of quantitative data is financial statements. The qualitative fundamentals are less tangible. They might include the quality of a companys key executives, brand-name recognition, patents, and proprietary technology . Neither qualitative nor quantitative analysis is inherently better. Many analysts consider them together. Fast Fact Fundamental analysis relies on using financial ratios drawn from data on corporate financial statements to make inferences about a companys value and prospects. Qualitative Fundamentals to Consider There are certain qualitative fundamentals that analysts should always consider when analyzing a company. These include the following The Business Model What exactly does the company do? This isnt always straightforward. If a companys business model is based on selling fast-food chicken, is it making its money that way? Or is it coasting on royalty and franchise fees? Competitive Advantage A companys long-term success is primarily driven by its ability to maintain its competitive advantage. Competitive advantages, such as Coca-Cola Co.s KO brand name and Microsoft Corporations MSFT long domination of the personal computer operating system, create a moat around a business, allowing it to keep competitors at bay and enjoy growth and profits. Management Team Some think management is the most important criterion for investing in a company. This makes sense Even the best business model is doomed if the companys leaders fail to execute the plan properly. While its hard for retail investors to meet and truly evaluate managers, you can look at the corporate website and check the resumes of the top brass and the board members. How well did they do in previous jobs? Have they been unloading a lot of their stock shares lately? Corporate Governance and Board Structure These are provided by the policies within an organization that indicate the relationships and responsibilities among management, directors, and stakeholders . These policies are defined and determined in the company charter, its bylaws, and corporate laws and regulations. You want to do business with a company that is run ethically, fairly, transparently, and efficiently. Note whether management respects shareholder rights and shareholder interests. Ensure their communications to shareholders are transparent and understandable. If you dont get it, if there are major issues you know surround the company and they arent addressed, its not a sign that they have good answers for you. Industry Trends Its also important to consider a companys industry its customer base, market share among firms, industrywide growth, competition, regulation, and business cycles. Learning how the industry works will give an investor a deeper understanding of a companys financial health. Stakeholder Satisfaction Employees, managers, customers, suppliers, investors, and other stakeholders should all have positive views on the company and its prospects. Without that, a companys brand equity and image can suffer, which can lead to fewer sales, lower profits, and flagging share prices. Quantitative Fundamentals to Consider Financial Ratios Financial statements are how a company discloses information about its financial performance. Here are some of the most important financial ratios with their formulas Key Financial Ratios Category Ratio Formula Profitability Gross profit margin Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold Revenue Higher margins and returns generally indicate a more profitable and efficient business. Operating profit margin Operating Income Revenue Net profit Margin Net Income Revenue Return on assets ROA Net Income Average Total Assets Return on equity ROE Net Income Average Shareholders Equity Liquidity Current ratio Current Assets Current Liabilities A higher ratio suggests that the company has enough liquidity to cover its near-term liabilities. Quick ratio Cash Marketable Securities Accounts Receivable Current Liabilities Solvency Debt-to-equity ratio Total Liabilities Total Shareholders Equity These ratios measure a companys ability to meet its long-term debt obligations. Lower debt ratios and higher interest coverage ratios generally indicate a more financially stable company. Debt-to-assets ratio Total Liabilities Total Assets Interest coverage ratio Operating Income Interest Expense Efficiency Asset turnover ratio Revenue Average Total Assets These ratios measure how effectively a company manages its assets to generate sales.

Inventory turnover ratio Cost of Goods Sold Average Inventory Receivables turnover ratio Revenue Average Accounts Receivable Valuation PE Market Price per Share Earnings per Share Lower ratios may indicate that the stock is undervalued, while higher ratios may suggest that it is overvalued.

Technical analysis uses price trends and action, often plotted on charts, to create indicators and identify patterns. Some indicators develop patterns that have names resembling their shapes, such as the head and shoulders pattern. A major distinction is where value comes from. For technical analysts, the market sets prices, and hence, the changes there give a company its value. For fundamental analysts, there is an intrinsic value that the market can often miss. Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis Fundamental Analysis Estimates the intrinsic value of a company from its operations Considers a companys financial statements and qualitative factors Longer-term focus monthsyears Best for buy-and hold investing Technical Analysis Looks at price and market trends to uncover market psychology Considers historical prices and chart patterns Shorter-term focus daysweeks Best for short-term or swing trading Limitations of Fundamental Analysis Though fundamental analysis can provide investors with insights into the future of a company, it does come with some downsides. Keep these items in mind when performing fundamental analysis Its Time-Consuming Fundamental analysis involves a detailed examination of financial statements, economic data, industry reports, and company-specific factors. This process requires collecting extensive data, performing complex calculations, and interpreting various financial metrics. Its A Lagging Indicator In addition to being a slow process, fundamental analysis often acts as a lagging indicator because it relies on financial data that reflects past performance. By the time changes in a companys fundamentals become apparent in its financial statements, the stock price might have already adjusted. Relies on Historical Data Similarly, fundamental analysis is based largely on historical financial information. While this data provides a basis for estimating future performance, it may not fully capture future risks or opportunities, as past performance is not an indicator of whats to come in the future. Subject to Accounting Practices The accuracy of fundamental analysis depends on the integrity and transparency of a companys financial statements. Factors like management estimates, depreciation, or other GAAP-compliant requirements can perhaps improperly impact the fundamental analysis. Difficult to Value Intangibles Intangible assets like patents, trademarks, brand reputation, and human capital are increasingly important in todays economy. However, these assets are challenging to quantify and may not be fully reflected in a companys financial statements. Consider how some investors would have believed in Apple simply because of Steve Jobs that notion is not captured in fundamental analysis. Economic Assumptions Fundamental analysis often involves assumptions about future economic conditions such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. Again, these are always changing and may not materialize as expected. Overlooked Short-Term Opportunities Fundamental analysis is geared towards long-term investment decisions, focusing on a companys intrinsic value and potential for growth over time. This long-term focus might cause investors to miss short-term trading opportunities that technical analysis can identify, such as price patterns, volume spikes, or momentum indicators. Example of Fundamental Analysis Lets analyze a hypothetical company called ABC Inc. using fundamental analysis. Well examine its financial statements and calculate key ratios to assess its financial health and performance. First, lets look at some data from ABC Inc.s financial statements for the previous fiscal year ABC Income Statement Balance Sheet Income Statement millions . Balance Sheet millions Revenue 1,000 . Assets Cost of Goods Sold 600 . Current Assets 750 Gross Profit 400 . Cash 200 Operating Expenses 200 . Marketable Securities 250 Operating Income 200 . Accounts Receivable 300 Net Income 150 . Non-Current Assets 750 . Total Assets 1,500 . ------------------ . Liabilities . Current Liabilities 250 . Non-Current Liabilities 250 . Total Liabilities 500 . . Shareholder Equity 1,000 ABC Statement of Cash Flows Stock Information Cash Flows from millions . Stock Information Operations 250 . Shares Outstanding 100 million Investments 100 . Stock Price 25.00 Financing 150 . Now, lets calculate some key ratios Profitability Ratios Gross profit margin 1,000 - 600 1,000 40 Operating profit margin 200 1,000 20 Net profit margin 150 1,000 15 Return on assets ROA 150 1,500 10 Return on equity ROE 150 1,000 15 ABC Inc.s profitability ratios suggest that the company is generating healthy profits from its operations. Its gross margin is 40, operating margin is 20, and net margin is 15. Its ROA and ROE of 10 and 15, respectively, indicate that the company is generating solid returns on its assets and equity. Liquidity Ratios Current ratio 750 250 3.00 Quick ratio 200 150 200 250 2.20 Assuming ABC Inc.s current assets are 750 million, with 200 million in cash, 150 million in marketable securities, and 200 million in accounts receivable, and its current liabilities are 250 million, the companys liquidity ratios are strong. A current ratio of 3.0 and a quick ratio of 2.2 suggest that ABC Inc. has ample liquidity to cover its short-term obligations. Solvency Ratios Debt-to-equity ratio 500 1,000 0.50 Debt-to-assets ratio 500 1,500 0.33 ABC Inc.s solvency ratios indicate that the company has a manageable level of debt relative to its equity and assets. A debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5 and a debt-to-assets ratio of 0.33 suggest that the company is not overly leveraged and has the financial flexibility to meet its long-term obligations. Valuation Ratios Assuming ABC Inc. has 100 million shares outstanding and its stock price is 25 per share Price-to-earnings PE Ratio 25 150 100 16.67 Price-to-book PB Ratio 25 1,000 100 2.50 Price-to-sales PS Ratio 25 1,000 100 2.50 ABC Inc.s valuation ratios suggest that the companys stock is trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its earnings, book value, and sales. A PE ratio of 16.67 aligns with the broader market, while PB and PS ratios of 2.5 indicate that the stock is not overly expensive relative to the companys assets and revenue. In addition to these quantitative measures, we can also consider certain qualitative fundamentals Competitive Advantages Has strong brand recognition in its industry and high customer loyalty Proprietary technology that differentiates its products from competitors Efficient supply chain and distribution network, enabling faster delivery and lower costs Management Quality It has an experienced management team with a proven track record of success. The CEO has been with the company for 15 years and has led the company through several periods of growth. Management has demonstrated a commitment to creating new goods and services and has strategic investments in research and development. Industry Trends The industry in which ABC Inc. operates is growing at a steady rate of 5 per year. Theres increasing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable products, which aligns with ABC Inc.s product offerings. The regulatory environment is becoming more favorable for the companys products. Growth Prospects ABC Inc. has a robust pipeline of new products set to launch in the next 12-18 months. The company has been expanding into new geographic markets and plans to enter two new countries next year. Recent acquisitions have provided opportunities for synergies and increased market share. Corporate Governance ABC Inc. has a diverse and independent board of directors. The company has a strong track record of transparency and timely financial reporting. Executive compensation is aligned with long-term shareholder interests. ESG Factors ABC Inc. has set ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint and increasing its use of renewable energy. The company is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, with programs in place to promote a diverse workforce. ABC Inc. engages with local communities and supports various philanthropic initiatives. Based on this hypothetical fundamental analysis, ABC Inc. appears to be a financially healthy and potentially attractive investment. However, its important to remember that this is just a simplified example. In practice, investors would need to conduct a more thorough analysis, considering the companys competitive position, industry trends, management quality, and growth prospects, before making an investment decision. What Is Fundamental Analysis and Its Objective? Fundamental analysis uses publicly available financial information and reports to determine whether a stock and the issuing company are valued correctly by the market. What Are the 3 Layers of Fundamental Analysis? When conducting an analysis, you can be top-down and start with economic analysis, then analyze the industry, then the company. Or, you can be bottom-up and work in the reverse order. What Are the Tools for Fundamental Analysis? Analysts use many tools. Some examples are financial reports, ratios from the reports, spreadsheets, charts, graphs, infographics, government agency reports on industries and the economy, and market reports. How Does Fundamental Analysis Differ From Technical Analysis? Fundamental analysis focuses on evaluating a securitys intrinsic value based on financial and economic factors, while technical analysis studies price movements and trading volumes to identify patterns and predict future price movements. Why Is Earnings Per Share EPS Important in Fundamental Analysis? EPS indicates a companys profitability on a per-share basis, helping investors determine how much profit a company generates for each share of its stock. It is a critical metric for assessing company performance and valuing stocks. The Bottom Line Fundamental analysis is used to value a company and determine whether a stock is over- or undervalued by the market. It considers the economic, market, sector-specific, and financial performance. Financial ratios generated from financial reports and government industry and economic reports are used to assess a company. Not every analyst uses the same tools or views stocks similarlyyou might determine a stock is valued differently than another analyst. Whats important is that the stock you analyze meets your criteria for value and that your analysis creates actionable information.",

    "text": "What Is an Investment Strategy? The term investment strategy refers to a set of principles designed to help an individual investor achieve their financial and investment goals. This plan is what guides an investors decisions based on goals, risk tolerance , and future needs for capital. They can vary from conservative where they follow a low-risk strategy where the focus is on wealth protection while others are highly aggressive seeking rapid growth by focusing on capital appreciation . Investors can use their strategies to formulate their own portfolios or do so through a financial professional. Strategies arent static, which means they need to be reviewed periodically as circumstances change. Key Takeaways An investment strategy is a plan designed to help individual investors achieve their financial and investment goals. Your investment strategy depends on your personal circumstances, including your age, capital, risk tolerance, and goals. Investment strategies range from conservative to highly aggressive, and include value and growth investing. You should reevaluate your investment strategies as your personal situation changes. Understanding Investment Strategies Investment strategies are styles of investing that help individuals meet their short- and long-term goals. Strategies depend on a variety of factors, including Age Goals Lifestyles Financial situations Available capital Personal situations family, living situation Expected returns This, of course, isnt an exhaustive list, and may include other details about the individual. These factors help an investor determine the kind of investments they choose to purchase, including stocks, bonds, money market funds , real estate, asset allocation , and how much risk they can tolerate. Investment strategies vary greatly. There isnt a one-size-fits-all approach to investing, which means there isnt one particular plan that works for everyone. This also means that people need to reevaluate and realign their strategies as they get older in order to adapt their portfolios to their situation. Investors can choose from value investing to growth investing and conservative to more risky approaches. As mentioned above, people can choose to make their investment decisions on their own or by using a financial professional. More experienced investors are able to make decisions and investment choices on their own. Keep in mind that there is no right way to manage a portfolio, but investors should behave rationally by doing their own research using facts and data to back up decisions by attempting to reduce risk and maintain sufficient liquidity . Important Because investment strategies depend so heavily on your personal situation and goals, its important for you to do your research before you commit your capital to any investment. Special Considerations Risk is a huge component of an investment strategy. Some individuals have a high tolerance for risk while other investors are risk-averse . Here are a few common risk-related rules Investors should only risk what they can afford to lose Riskier investments carry the potential for higher returns Investments that guarantee the preservation of capital also guarantee a minimal return For example, U.S. Treasury bonds , bills, and certificates of deposit CDs are considered safe because they are backed by the credit of the United States. However, these investments provide a low return on investment. Once the cost of inflation and taxes have been included in the return on income equation, there may be little growth in the investment. Along with risk, investors should also consider changing their investment strategies over time. For instance, a young investor saving for retirement may want to alter their investment strategy when they get older, shifting their choices from riskier investments to safer options. Types of Investment Strategies Investment strategies range from conservative plans to highly aggressive ones. A review of some of the top investors will show that there are a wide variety of strategies to consider. Conservative investment plans employ safe investments that come with low risks and provide stable returns. Highly aggressive ones are those that involve risky investments, such as stocks, options, and junk bonds , with the goal of generating maximum returns. People who have a greater investment horizon tend to employ aggressive plans because they have a longer timeline, while those who want to preserve capital are more likely to take a conservative approach. Many investors buy low-cost, diversified index funds, use dollar-cost averaging , and reinvest dividends . Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where a fixed dollar amount of stocks or a particular investment are acquired on a regular schedule regardless of the cost or share price. Some experienced investors, though, select individual stocks and build a portfolio based on individual firm analysis with predictions on share price movements. Value Investing vs. Growth Investing Some investors may choose strategies such as value and growth investing. With value investing, an investor chooses stocks that look as they though trade for less than their intrinsic value. This means that these stocks that the market is underestimating. Growth investing, on the other hand, involves investing capital in the stocks of junior companies that have the potential for earnings growth. Example of Investment Strategy A 25-year-old who starts off their career and begins saving for retirement may consider riskier investments because they have more time to invest and are more tolerant to risk They can also afford to lose some money in the event that the market takes a dive because they still have time earn more money. This means they can invest in things like stocks and real estate. A 45-year-old, on the other hand, doesnt have a lot of time to put money away for retirement and would be better off with a conservative plan. They may consider investing in things like bonds , government securities, and other safe bets. Meanwhile, someone saving for a vacation or home wont have the same strategy as someone saving for retirement. They may be better off putting their money away in a savings account or a CD for short-term goals like these.",

    "text": "Definition Diversification is the strategy of investing in different asset classes and asset types to reduce portfolio risk associated with price volatility. What Is Diversification? Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt to limit exposure to any single asset or risk . The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security. Key Takeaways Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in an attempt to reduce portfolio risk. Diversification is most often done by investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrency and then in different types of securities within a class. Diversification can also be achieved by purchasing investments in different countries, industries, sizes of companies, or term lengths for income-generating investments. The quality of diversification in a portfolio is most often measured by analyzing the correlation coefficient of pairs of assets. Investors can diversify on their own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds. Understanding Diversification Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness. Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the negative performance of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences. Diversification Strategies As investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. Many of the methods below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio. Asset Classes Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Each asset class has a different, unique set of risks and opportunities. Classes can include Stocks Shares or equity in a publicly traded company Bonds Government and corporate fixed-income debt instruments Real estate Land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits Exchange-traded funds ETFs A marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector Commodities Basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services Cash and short-term cash-equivalents CCE Treasury bills, certificate of deposit CD, money market vehicles, and other short-term, low-risk investments The theory holds that what may negatively impact one asset class may benefit another. For example, rising interest rates usually negatively impact bond prices as yield must increase to make fixed income securities more attractive. On the other hand, rising interest rates may result in increases in rent for real estate or increases in prices for commodities.

IndustriesSectors There are tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. As investors diversify across various industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk. For example, consider the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. This legislation impacts many industries, though some companies are more affected than others. Semiconductor manufacturers will be largely impacted, while the financial services sector might feel smaller, residual impacts. Investors can diversify across industries by coupling investments that may counterbalance different businesses. For example, consider two major means of entertainment travel and digital streaming. Investors hoping to hedge against the risk of future major pandemic impacts may invest in digital streaming platforms positively impacted by more shutdowns. At the same time, they may consider simultaneously investing in airlines positively impacted by fewer shutdowns. In theory, these two unrelated industries may minimize overall portfolio risk. Important How many stocks do you need to own to be properly diversified? A study published in the Journal of Risk and Financial Management found there are simply too many variables to consider, and an optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist. Corporate Lifecycle Stages Growth vs. Value Public equities tend to be broken into two categories growth stocks and value stocks . Growth stocks are stocks in companies that are expected to experience profit or revenue growth greater than the industry average. Value stocks are stocks in companies that appear to be trading at a discount based on the current fundamentals of a company. Growth stocks tend to be more risky as the expected growth of a company may not materialize. For example, if the Federal Reserve constricts monetary policy, less capital is usually available or it is more expensive to borrow, creating a more difficult scenario for growth companies. However, growth companies may tap into seemingly limitless potential and exceed expectations, generating even greater returns than expected. On the other hand, value stocks tend to be more established, stable companies. While these companies may have already experienced most of their potential, they usually carry less risk. By diversifying into both, an investor would capitalize on the future potential of some companies while also recognizing the existing benefits of others. Market Capitalizations Large vs. Small Investors may want to consider investing across different securities based on the underlying market capitalization of the asset or company. Consider the vast operational differences between Apple and Newell Brands Inc. In July 2023, both companies were in the SP 500, with Apple representing 7.6 of the index and Newell Brands representing 0.0065. Each company will have a considerably different approach to raising capital, introducing new products to the market, brand recognition, and growth potential. Lower cap stocks have more room to grow, though higher cap stocks tend to be safer investments. Risk Profiles Across almost every asset class, investors can choose the underlying risk profile of the security. For example, consider fixed-income securities. An investor can choose to buy bonds from the top-rated governments in the world or from nearly defunct private companies raising emergency funds . There are considerable differences between several 10-year bonds based on the issuer, their credit rating, future operational outlook, and existing level of debt. The same can be said for other types of investments. Real estate development projects with more risk may carry greater upside than established operating properties. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies with longer histories and greater adoption, such as Bitcoin, carry less risk relative to smaller market cap coins or tokens. Tip Diversification may not be the best strategy for investors wanting to maximize their returns. Consider YOLO you only live once strategies where 100 of capital is placed in a high-risk investment. Though there is a higher probability of making life-changing money, there is also the highest probability of losing it due to poor diversification. Maturity Lengths Specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds, different term lengths impact risk profiles. Generally, the longer the maturity , the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bonds prices due to changes in interest rates. Short-term bonds tend to offer lower interest rates however, they also tend to be less impacted by uncertainty in future yield curves. Investors more comfortable with risk may consider adding longer term bonds that tend to pay higher degrees of interest. Maturity length is also prevalent in other asset classes. Consider the difference between short-term lease agreements for residential properties i.e., up to one year and long-term lease agreements for commercial properties i.e., sometimes five years or greater. Though there is more security in collecting rent revenue by locking into a long-term agreement, investors sacrifice flexibility to increase prices or change tenants. Physical Locations Foreign vs. Domestic Investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japans economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn. Alternatively, there may be a greater potential upside with associated higher degrees of risk when diversifying across developed and emerging countries. Consider Pakistans current classification as a frontier market participant recently downgraded from an emerging market participant. Investors willing to take on higher levels of risk may want to consider the higher growth potential of smaller yet-to-be-fully established markets such as Pakistan. Tangibility Financial instruments such as stocks and bonds are intangible investments they can not be physically touched or felt. On the other hand, tangible investments such as land, real estate, farmland, precious metals, or commodities can be touched and have real-world applications. These real assets have different investment profiles as they can be consumed, rented, developed, or treated differently than intangible or digital assets. There are also unique risks specific to tangible assets. Real property can be vandalized, physically stolen, damaged by natural conditions, or become obsolete. Real assets may also require storage, insurance, or security costs to carry. Though the revenue stream differs from financial instruments, the input costs to protect tangible assets are also different. Diversification Across Platforms Regardless of how an investor considers building their portfolio, another aspect of diversification relates to how those assets are held. Though this is not an implication of the investments risk, it is an additional risk worth considering as it may be diversifiable. For example, consider an individual with 400,000 of U.S. currency. In all three of the situations below, the investor has the same asset allocation. However, their risk profile is different The individual may deposit 200,000 at one bank and 200,000 at a second bank. Both deposits are under the FDIC insurance limit per bank and are fully insured. The individual may deposit 400,000 at a single bank. Only a portion of the deposit is covered by insurance. In addition, should that single bank experience a bank run, the individual may not have immediate access to cash. The individual may physically store 400,000 of cash in their home. Though immediately accessible, the individual will not yield any interest or growth on their cash. In addition, the individual may lose capital in the event of theft, fire, or by misplacing it. The same concept above relates to almost every asset class. For example, Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Investors holding cryptocurrency with the exchange experienced the inability to withdraw or transfer funds. Had investors diversified across platforms, the risk of loss would have been spread across different exchanges. Fast Fact Consider different strategies to offset technology risk and physical risk. For example, owning physical gold bars and gold ETFs diversifies your portfolio across various risks. If your physical holdings were to be stolen, at least 100 of your gold ownership was not lost. Diversification and Retail Investors Time and budget constraints can make it difficult for noninstitutional investorsi.e., individualsto create an adequately diversified portfolio. This challenge is a key to why mutual funds are so popular with retail investors. Buying shares in a mutual fund offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments. While mutual funds provide diversification across various asset classes, exchange-traded funds ETFs afford investor access to narrow markets, such as commodities and international plays, that would ordinarily be difficult to access. An individual with a 100,000 portfolio can spread the investment among ETFs with no overlap. There are several reasons why this is advantageous to investors. First, it may be too costly for retail investors to buy securities using different market orders. In addition, investors must then track their portfolios weight to ensure proper diversification. Though an investor sacrifices a say in all of the underlying companies being invested in, they simply choose an easier investment approach that prioritizes minimizing risk. Pros and Cons of Diversification The primary purpose of diversification is to mitigate risk. By spreading your investment across different asset classes, industries, or maturities, you are less likely to experience market shocks that impact every single one of your investments the same. There are other benefits to be had as well. Some investors may find diversification makes investing more fun as it encourages exploring different unique investments. Diversification may also increase the chance of hitting positive news. Instead of hoping for favorable news specific to one company, positive news impacting one of dozens of companies may benefit your portfolio. However, there are drawbacks to diversification. The more holdings a portfolio has, the more time-consuming it can be to manageand the more expensive, since buying and selling many different holdings incurs more transaction fees and brokerage commissions. More fundamentally, diversifications spreading-out strategy works both ways, lessening the risk and the reward. For instance, imagine youve invested 120,000 equally among six stocks, and one stock doubles in value. Your original 20,000 stake is now worth 40,000. Youve made a lot, sure, but not as much as if your entire 120,000 had been invested in that one company. By protecting you on the downside, diversification limits you on the upsideat least in the short term. Pros Reduces portfolio risk Hedges against market volatility Offers potentially higher returns long-term May be more enjoyable for investors to research new investments Cons Limits gains short-term Time-consuming to manage Incurs more transaction fees, commissions May be overwhelming for newer, unexperienced investors Diversifiable vs. Non-Diversifiable Risk The idea behind diversification is to minimize or even eliminate risk within a portfolio. However, there are certain types of risks you can diversify away, and certain types of risks exist regardless of how you diversify. These types of risks are called unsystematic and systematic risks . Consider the impact of COVID-19. Due to the global health crisis, many businesses stopped operating. Employees across many industries were laid off, and consumer spending across all sectors declined. On one hand, the economic slowdown negatively impacted almost every sector. On the other, nearly every sector then benefited from government intervention and monetary stimulus. The impact of COVID-19 on financial markets was systematic. In general, diversification aims to reduce unsystematic risk. These are the risks specific to an investment that are unique to that holding. Examples of diversifiable, non-systematic risks include Business risk The risk related to a specific company based on the nature of its company and what it does in the market. Financial risk The risks related to a specific company or organizations financial health, liquidity, and long-term solvency. Operational risk The risk related to breakdowns in manufacturing or goods distribution processes. Regulatory risk The risk that legislation may adversely impact the asset. Through diversification, investors strive to reduce the risks above, which are controllable based on the investments held. Measuring Diversification It can become complex and cumbersome to measure how diversified a portfolio is . In reality, it is impossible to calculate the actual degree of diversification there are simply too many variables to consider across too many assets to truly quantify a single measure of diversification. Still, analysts and portfolio managers use several measurements to get a rough idea of how diversified a portfolio is. Correlation Coefficient A correlation coefficient is a statistical measurement that compares the relationship between two variables. This statistical calculation tracks the movement of two assets and whether the assets tend to move in the same direction. The correlation coefficient result varies from -1 to 1, with interpretations ranging from Closer to -1 There is strong diversification between the two assets, as the investments move in opposite directions. There is a strong negative correlation between the two variables being analyzed. Closer to 0 There is moderate diversification between the two assets, as the investments have no correlation. The assets sometimes move together, while other times, they dont. Closer to 1 There is a strong lack of diversification between the two assets, as the investments move in the same direction. There is a strong positive correlation between the two variables being analyzed. Standard Deviation Standard deviation SD measures how often and far an outcome occurs away from the mean. For investments, standard deviation measures how far away from an assets average return other returns fall. Analysts use SD to estimate risk based on return frequency. For example, imagine two investments, each with an average annual return of 5. One has a high standard deviation, which means the investment returns can vary greatly. The other investment has a low standard deviation, meaning its returns have been closer to 5. The higher the standard deviation, the more risk there isbut there is a chance for higher returns. A portfolio full of investments with high standard deviations may have higher earning potential. However, these assets may be more likely to experience similar risks across asset classes. Smart Beta Smart beta strategies offer diversification by tracking underlying indices but do not necessarily weigh stocks according to their market cap. ETF managers further screen equity issues on fundamentals and rebalance portfolios according to objective analysis, not just company size. While smart beta portfolios are unmanaged, the primary goal becomes the outperformance of the index itself. CountWeighting In its most basic form, a portfolios diversification can be measured by counting the number of assets or determining the weight of each asset. When counting the number of assets, consider the number of each type for the strategies above. For example, an investor can count that of the 20 equities they hold, 15 are in the technology sector. Alternatively, investors can measure diversification by allocating percentages to what they are invested in. So, in this view, the investor with 15 equities in tech has 75 of their equity holdings in a single industry. On a broader portfolio basis, investors more often compare equity, bonds, and alternative assets to create their diversification targets. For example, traditional portfolios tended to skew towards 60 equities and 40 bondsthough some strategies call for different diversification based on age. Other theories claim that holding alternative assets has added benefits for example, 60 equities, 20 bonds, and 20 alternatives. Example of Diversification Imagine an aggressive investor , who can assume a higher risk level, wishes to construct a portfolio composed of Japanese equities, Australian bonds, and cotton futures. They could purchase stakes in the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, the Vanguard Australian Government Bond Index ETF, and the iPath Bloomberg Cotton Subindex Total Return ETN. With this mix of ETF shares, due to the specific qualities of the targeted asset classes and the transparency of the holdings, the investor ensures true diversification in their holdings. Also, with different correlations, or responses to outside forces, among the securities, they can slightly lessen their risk exposure. What Are the Benefits of Diversification? In theory, holding investments that are different from each other reduces the overall risk of the assets youre invested in. If something bad happens to one investment, youre more likely to have assets that are not impacted if you were diversified. Diversification may result in a larger profit if you are extended into asset classes you wouldnt otherwise have invested in. Also, some investors find diversification more enjoyable to pursue as they research new companies, explore different asset classes, and own different types of investments. What Are the Methods of Diversification? There are many different ways to diversify the primary method of diversification is to buy different types of asset classes. For example, instead of putting your entire portfolio into public stock, you may consider buying some bonds to offset some market risk of stocks. In addition to investing in different asset classes, you can diversify into different industries, geographical locations, term lengths, or market caps. The primary goal of diversification is to invest in a broad range of assets that face different risks. Is Diversification a Good Strategy? For investors seeking to minimize risk, diversification is a strong strategy. That said, diversification may minimize returns, as the goal of diversification is to reduce the risk within a portfolio. By reducing risk, an investor is willing to take less profit in exchange for the preservation of capital. The Bottom Line Diversification is a very important concept in financial planning and investment management. It is the idea that by investing in different things, the overall risk of your portfolio is lower. Instead of putting all your money into a single asset, spreading your wealth across different assets puts you at less risk of losing capital. With the ease of transacting and investing online, it is now incredibly easy to diversify your portfolio through different asset classes and other strategies.",

    "text": "Definition The term asset allocation refers to the process of dividing a financial or investment portfolio between different assets classes. Asset allocation is how investors divide their portfolios among different assets that might include equities, fixed-income assets, and cash and its equivalents. Investors ordinarily aim to balance risks and rewards based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and the investment horizon. Key Takeaways Asset allocation is how investors split up their portfolios among different kinds of assets. The three main asset classes are equities, fixed income, and cash and cash equivalents. Each asset class has different risks and return potential, so each will behave differently over time. No simple formula can find the right asset allocation for every individual investor. Investopedia Joules Garcia Why Is Asset Allocation Important? Theres no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone, but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors make. Selecting individual securities within an asset class is done only after you decide how to divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. This will largely determine your investment results. Investors use different asset allocations for distinct goals. Someone saving to buy a new car in the next year might invest those savings in a conservative mix of cash, certificates of deposit, and short-term bonds . However, individuals saving for retirement decades away typically invest most of their retirement accounts in stocks because they have a lot of time to ride out the markets short-term fluctuations. Fast Fact Risk tolerance plays a key factor as well. Those uncomfortable investing in stocks may put their money in a more conservative asset class despite having a long-term investment horizon. Age-Based Asset Allocation Financial advisors generally recommend holding stocks for five years or longer. Cash and money market accounts are appropriate for goals less than a year away. Bonds fall somewhere in between. Financial advisors once recommended subtracting an investors age from 100 to determine what percentage should be invested in stocks. A 40-year-old would, therefore, be 60 invested in stocks. Variations of this rule recommend subtracting age from 110 or 120, given that average life expectancy continues to grow. Portfolios should generally move to a more conservative asset allocation to help lower risk as individuals approach retirement. Asset Allocation Through Life-Cycle Funds Some asset-allocation mutual funds are known as life-cycle or target-date funds. They set out to provide investors with portfolios that address their age, risk appetite, and investment goals with the correlated parts of different asset classes. Critics of this approach point out that a standardized solution for allocating portfolio assets is wrongheaded because individual investors require individual solutions. These funds gradually reduce the risk in their portfolios as they near the target date, cutting riskier stocks and adding safer bonds to preserve the nest egg. The Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 is an example of a target-date fund. The Vanguard 2030 fund is for people expecting to retire just before or after 2030. As of Aug. 31, 2023, its portfolio comprises 63 stocks, 36 bonds, and 1 short-term reserves. This asset allocation was achieved by investing in the following four funds Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund How Do Economic Changes Affect Asset Allocation Strategies? Economic cycles of growth and contraction greatly affect how you should allocate your assets. During bull markets, investors ordinarily prefer growth-oriented assets like stocks to profit from better market conditions. Alternatively, during downturns or recessions, investors tend to shift toward more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents, which can help preserve capital. What Is an Asset Allocation Fund? An asset allocation fund provides investors with a diversified portfolio of investments across various asset classes. The asset allocation of the fund can be fixed or variable among a mix of asset classes. It may be held to fixed percentages of asset classes or allowed to lean further on some, depending on market conditions. What Is a Good Asset Allocation? What works for one person might not work for another. There is no such thing as a perfect asset allocation model. A good asset allocation varies by individual and can depend on various factors, including age, financial targets, and appetite for risk. Historically, an asset allocation of 60 stocks and 40 bonds was considered optimal. However, some professionals say this idea needs to be revised, particularly given the poorer performance of bonds in recent years, and say other asset classes should also be introduced to portfolios. What Is the Best Asset Allocation Strategy for My Age? Generally, the younger and further you are from needing to access the capital invested, the more you should invest in stocks. One common guideline thats ordinarily quoted is that you should hold a percentage of stocks that is equal to 100 minus your age. So, if you are 30, 70 of your portfolio should supposedly consist of stocks. The rest would then be allocated to safer assets, such as bonds . But a lot of these rules dont work for everyone. For advice that reflects your personal circumstances, reach out to a financial advisor. How Does Behavioral Finance View Asset Allocation? Behavioral finance explores how common cognitive errors might influence our financial choices. For our asset allocation, we might be swayed too much by recent market trends, overconfidence, sunk-cost reasoning, or loss aversion, which can lead to less beneficial allocation choices. Awareness of these cognitive biases can help you keep a disciplined, long-term approach aligned with your goals. The Bottom Line Most financial professionals will tell you that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors can make. The selection of individual securities is secondary to how assets are allocated in stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents, which will play more of a role in your investment results.",

    "text": "What Is Rebalancing? Rebalancing refers to the process of returning the values of a portfolios asset allocations to the levels defined by an investment plan . Those levels are intended to match an investors tolerance for risk and desire for reward. Over time, asset allocations can change as market performance alters the values of the assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling the assets in a portfolio to regain and maintain that original, desired level of asset allocation . Take a portfolio with an original target asset allocation of 50 stocks and 50 bonds. If the stocks prices rose during a certain period of time, their higher value could increase their allocation proportion within the portfolio to, say, 70. The investor may then decide to sell some stocks and buy bonds to realign the percentages back to the original target allocation of 50-50. Key Takeaways Rebalancing is the act of adjusting a portfolios changed asset allocation to match an original allocation defined by an investors risk and reward profile. There are several types of strategies for rebalancing, such as calendar, constant-mix, and portfolio-insurance. Calendar rebalancing is the least costly but is not responsive to market fluctuations. The constant-mix strategy is responsive but more costly to use than calendar rebalancing. Costs of rebalancing can include transaction fees, inadvertent exposure to higher risk, and selling assets as they are increasing in value. How Rebalancing Works Portfolio rebalancing aims to protect investors from exposure to undesirable risks while providing exposure to reward. It can also ensure that a portfolios exposure remains within the portfolio managers area of expertise. There are times when a stocks price performance can vary more dramatically than that of bonds. Therefore, a portfolios percentage of equity-related assets should be assessed as market conditions change. If the value of equities in a portfolio causes the allocation in stocks to rise above their preset percentage, a rebalancing may be in order. That would involve selling some shares of stock to lower the overall percentage of equities in the portfolio. Investors may also wish to adjust their overall portfolio risk to meet changing financial needs. For instance, an investor who needs a greater potential for return might increase the allocation in assets that involve higher risk, such as equities, to improve that potential. Or, if income becomes more important than it was before, the allocation of bonds could be increased. Some investors may mistakenly understand rebalancing to refer to adjusting for an even distribution of assets. However, a 50-50 stock and bond split is not required. A portfolios target allocation of assets just as easily could be 70 stocks and 30 bonds, 40 stocks and 60 bonds, or 10 cash, 40 stocks, and 50 bonds. The allocation depends on the goals and needs of an investor. When to Rebalance While there is no required schedule for rebalancing a portfolio , its recommended that investors examine allocations at least once every year. Investors dont have to rebalance but generally, thats ill-advised. Rebalancing gives investors the opportunity to sell high and buy low, taking the gains from high-performing investments and reinvesting them in areas that are expected to see notable growth. Important An investment planwhere asset allocations and rebalancing are definedcan range from a simple idea or strategy created by an individual to a multi-page package developed by a portfolio manager. An investment plan can help ensure that every investor takes needed actions, including rebalancing, and avoids inappropriate steps that could affect a portfolios return negatively. Types of Rebalancing Calendar Rebalancing Calendar rebalancing is the most rudimentary rebalancing approach. This strategy involves analyzing and adjusting the investment holdings within the portfolio at predetermined times. Many long-term investors rebalance once a year. Other types of investors with different outlooks and goals may rebalance quarterly, or even monthly. Weekly rebalancing could be overly expensive and unnecessary. The ideal frequency of rebalancing must be determined based on an investors time constraints, threshold for transaction costs, and allowance for value drift. Advantages of calendar rebalancing over more responsive methods are that it is less time consuming and costly for the investor since it involves fewer rebalancing occasions and potentially fewer trades. However, a downside is that it does not call for rebalancing at other dates even if the market moves significantly. Constant-Mix Rebalancing A more responsive approach to rebalancing focuses on the allowable percentage composition of an asset in a portfolio. This is known as a constant-mix strategy with bands or corridors. Every asset class , or individual security, is given a target weight and a corresponding tolerance range. For example, an allocation strategy might include the requirement to hold 30 in emerging market equities, 30 in domestic blue chips and 40 in government bonds with a corridor of - 5 for each asset class. Therefore, emerging market and domestic blue chip holdings can both fluctuate between 25 and 35. At the same time, 35 to 45 of the portfolio must be allocated to government bonds. When the weight of any one holding moves outside of its allowable band, the entire portfolio is rebalanced to reflect the initial target composition. Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance The most intensive rebalancing strategy commonly used is constant proportion portfolio insurance CPPI is a type of portfolio insurance that allows the investor to set a floor on the dollar value of their portfolio and structure the asset allocation on it. The asset classes in CPPI are styled as a risky asset, such as equities or mutual funds, and a conservative asset of either cash, cash equivalents, or treasury bonds. The percentage allocated to each depends on a cushion value, defined as the current portfolio value minus some floor value, and a multiplier coefficient. The greater the multiplier number, the more aggressive the rebalancing strategy. The outcome of the CPPI strategy is somewhat similar to that of buying a synthetic call option that does not use actual option contracts. CPPI is sometimes referred to as a convex strategy. Smart Beta Rebalancing Smart beta rebalancing is a periodic rebalancing similar to the regular rebalancing that indexes undergo to adjust to changes in stock value and market capitalization. Smart beta strategies take a rules-based approach to avoid the market inefficiencies that creep into index investing due to the reliance on market capitalization. Smart beta rebalancing uses additional criteria, such as value as defined by performance measures like book value or return on capital, to allocate the holdings across a selection of stocks. This rules-based method of portfolio creation adds a layer of systematic analysis to the investment that simple index investing lacks. Although smart beta rebalancing is more active than simply using index investing to mimic the overall market, it is less active than stock picking. One of the key features of smart beta rebalancing is that emotions are taken out of the process. Depending on how the rules are set up, an investor may end up trimming exposure to their top performers and increasing exposure to less stellar performers. This runs counter to the old adage of letting your winners run , but the periodic rebalancing realizes the profits regularly rather than trying to time market sentiment for maximum profit. Smart beta can also be used to rebalance across asset classes if the proper parameters are set. In this case, the risk-weighted returns are often used to compare different types of investments and adjust exposure accordingly. Examples of Rebalancing Rebalancing Retirement Accounts One of the most common areas investors look to rebalance is the allocations within their retirement accounts . Asset performance impacts the overall value, and many investors prefer to invest more aggressively at younger ages and more conservatively as they approach retirement age. Often, the portfolio is at its most conservative once the investor prepares to draw out the funds to supply retirement income. So, over the years, a portfolio may be rebalanced to reflect an increasingly greater allocation in fixed income securities . Rebalancing for Diversification Depending on market performance, investors may find a large number of assets held within one area. For example, should the value of stock X increase by 25 while stock Y only gained 5, a large amount of the value in the portfolio is tied to stock X. Should stock X experience a sudden downturn, the portfolio will suffer higher losses by association. Rebalancing lets the investor redirect some of the funds currently held in stock X to another investment, be that more of stock Y or purchasing a new stock entirely. By having funds spread out across multiple stocks, a downturn in one will be partially offset by the activities of the others, which can provide a level of portfolio stability. Advantages and Disadvantages of Rebalancing Advantages Rebalancing can keep investors portfolios aligned with their risk tolerance and need for a certain amount of return. It maintains a pre-determined asset allocation set by an investment plan. Its a disciplined, unemotional investment approach that can reduce exposure to risk. It can be changed as investors financial needs and investment goals change. Rebalancing can be done by experienced individual investors or handled by portfolio managers. Disadvantages Rebalancing involves transaction costs, which may reduce net income. Selling securities that have increased in value to rebalance a portfolio might lead to investors missing out on an upward price trend of those securities. Investing knowledge and experience is required to rebalance as needed and reduce exposure to risk appropriately. Unnecessary rebalancing can increase costs for an investor. What Does Rebalancing a Portfolio Mean? It means selling and buying the necessary securities to bring the value of each allocation in a portfolio back to the level established by an investment plan. Does Rebalancing Have Costs? Yes, it does. It involves the fees related to the transactions to purchase and sell securities. It can also involve the cost of performance. For example, to rebalance, you might sell securities that have increased in value and pushed your allocations out of whack. However, you could miss out on a continued upswing in prices that those securities experience. By making rebalancing part of an investment plan that you commit to, youll be aware of and can accept these and other potential costs in advance. How Often Should I Rebalance? That depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial needs. For example, long-term investors who take a buy and hold approach to the markets might consider reviewing their allocations once a year with their financial advisors to see if rebalancing is warranted. Other investors with shorter-term goals may wish to rebalance more frequently to be sure they stay on track to meet those goals.",

    "text": "Definition A bull market is a period in which financial market prices are climbing or are anticipated to go up. What Is a Bull Market? In the financial markets, such as stocks, when prices have generally been increasing or are expected to increase, a bull market exists. Bull markets commonly refer to the stock market but can be applied to anything that is traded, such as bonds, real estate, currencies, and commodities. Bull markets may be evident during periods of economic growth when GDP rises and unemployment falls, and can exist over extended periods where equity prices rise over months or years. Key Takeaways The common threshold that marks a bull market is a 20 rise in stock prices. Traders employ a variety of strategies, such as increased buy and hold and retracement, to profit from bull markets. The opposite of a bull market is a bear market, in which prices trend downward. Investopedia Xiaojie Liu Characteristics of a Bull Market Bull markets generally start when the economy is strong. They tend to coincide with a strong gross domestic product GDP , a drop in unemployment, and a rise in corporate profits. Growing investor confidence can keep bull markets moving. The overall demand for stocks is positive, along with the overall tone of the market. However, supply and demand for securities can vary with supply weak while demand is strong. It is difficult to predict consistently when trends in the market might change. No metric identifies a bull market, but the most common gauge used is a 20 or more rise in stock prices from recent lows. Analysts and investors commonly observe the following during a bull market An increase in trading volume, as more investors buy and hold securities to realize capital gains. Securities may receive higher valuations due to the perceived potential for price appreciation. Theres greater liquidity in the market, as there is more demand for securities and fewer sellers. Companies performing well in a bull market may reward their shareholders by increasing dividends. Initial public offerings IPOs may increase. Fast Fact The longest bull market in the history of the SP 500 Index lasted from March 2009 to February 2020 and saw the index gain over 300. It was characterized by strong earnings growth, low interest rates, and investor optimism. Trading Strategies Buy and hold Investors buy a particular security and hold it, hoping to sell it at a later date when prices have moved higher. The optimism thats a hallmark of bull markets helps to fuel the buy-and-hold approach. Increased buy and hold A variation of the straightforward buy-and-hold strategy, which involves additional risk. An investor will continue to add to their holdings in a particular security so long as that security continues to increase in price. Individuals may increase their position by buying a fixed quantity of shares with every pre-determined increase in the stock price. Retracement additions A retracement is a brief reversal in the general upward trend of a securitys price. Even during a bull market, its unlikely that stock prices will only ascend. Some investors watch for retracements within a bull market and buy the dip . Full swing trading Perhaps the most aggressive way of attempting to capitalize on a bull market is the process known as full swing trading . Investors may employ short-selling and other techniques to squeeze out maximum gains. Historic Bull Markets There have been several significant bull markets throughout history, each with its unique characteristics and drivers The Roaring Twenties This bull market occurred in the 1920s, was fueled by speculation, and lasted until the stock market crash of 1929 . The Reagan bull market of the 1980s In the 1980s, the stock market experienced a bull market accelerated by the economic policies of the Reagan administration. This bull market lasted over twelve years and ended with the Black Monday stock market crash in October 1987, which saw the SP 500 index decline by over 20 in a single day. The 1990s bull market Known as the dot-com bubble , this market was driven by the rapid growth of the internet and technology sectors. It lasted from the early 1990s until the early 2000s. The 2009 bull market This bull market began in March 2009 and lasted until February 2020, making it the longest bull market in history. What Is the Difference Between a Bull Market and a Bear Market? The opposite of a bull market is a bear market , which is characterized by falling prices and investor pessimism. Bull and bear markets often coincide with the economic cycle, which consists of four phases expansion, peak, contraction, and trough . The onset of a bull market is often a leading indicator of economic expansion. Bear markets usually begin before economic contraction. What Is the Bottom and Peak in Trading? Investors take advantage of rising prices and sell stocks when theyve reached their peak, or highest price. It is hard to determine when the bottom and peak will take place. Most losses result when investors miss the bottom or top. What Are Some Economic Indicators of a Strong Economy? In the U.S., low unemployment, high GDP, increased production, and increased consumer spending are all economic indicators that point to a strong or strengthening economy. The Bottom Line A bull market is a trend in a financial market characterized by rising prices and investor optimism. It can occur in the stock market as well as the bond, real estate, currency, and commodity markets. Bull markets may last for extended periods and are marked by increased demand for securities, rising corporate profits and GDP, and declining unemployment. The opposite of a bull market is a bear market, which is characterized by falling prices and investor pessimism.",

    "text": "Definition A bear market is a market condition where investors are more risk-averse than risk-seeking, defined by some as when prices have fallen more than 20 from previous highs. A bear market is a financial market experiencing prolonged price declines, generally of 20 or more. A bear market usually occurs along with widespread investor pessimism, large-scale liquidation of securities and other assets, and a weakening economy. Bear markets are often associated with declines in an overall market or index like the SP 500, but individual securities or commodities can also be considered to be in a bear market if they experience a decline of 20 or more over a sustained period of time, typically two months or more. Bear markets also may accompany general economic downturns such as a recession. Bear markets are seen as the opposite of upward-trending bull markets . Key Takeaways Bear markets occur when prices in a market decline by more than 20, often accompanied by negative investor sentiment and a weakening economy. Bear markets can be cyclical or longer-term. The former lasts for several weeks or a couple of months and the latter can last for several years or even decades. Short selling, put options, and inverse ETFs are some ways that investors can make money during a bear market as prices fall. Investopedia Daniel Fishel Understanding Bear Markets Stock prices generally reflect how investors expect companies to perform. If a company has lower-than-expected profits, or experiences less growth than analysts predicted, investors may respond by selling the companys stock, which makes the overall price decline. The combination of herd behavior and fear can create a rush to minimize losses, which in turn can lead to prolonged periods of depressed asset prices. One definition of a bear market says markets are in bear territory when stocks, on average, fall at least 20 off their high. But 20 is an arbitrary number, just as a 10 decline is an arbitrary benchmark for a correction. Another definition of a bear market is when investors are more risk-averse than risk-seeking. This kind of bear market can last for months or years as investors shun speculation in favor of boring, sure bets. The causes of a bear market often vary, but in general, a weak or slowing or sluggish economy , bursting market bubbles, pandemics, wars, geopolitical crises, and drastic paradigm shifts in the economy such as shifting to an online economy, are all factors that might cause a bear market. The signs of a weak or slowing economy are typically Low employment Low disposable income Weak productivity Drop in business profits Government interventions in the economy can also trigger a bear market. For example, changes in the tax rate or the federal funds rate can lead to a bear market. Similarly, a drop in investor confidence may also signal the onset of a bear market. When investors believe something is about to happen, they will take actionin the case of an imminent bear market, selling off shares to avoid losses. Bear markets can last for multiple years or just several weeks. A secular bear market can last anywhere from 10 to 20 years and is characterized by below-average returns on a sustained basis. There may be rallies within secular bear markets where stocks or indexes rally for a period, but the gains are not sustained, and prices revert to lower levels. A cyclical bear market, on the other hand, can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Recent Bear Markets The U.S. major market indexes were close to bear market territory on December 24, 2018, falling just shy of a 20 drawdown. More recently, major indexes including the SP 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell sharply into bear market territory between March 11 and March 12, 2020. Prior to that, the last prolonged bear market in the United States occurred between 2007 and 2009 during the Financial Crisis and lasted for roughly 17 months. The SP 500 lost 50 of its value during that time. In February 2020, global stocks entered a sudden bear market in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic, sending the DJIA down 38 from its all-time high on February 12 29,568.77 to a low on March 23 18,213.65 in just over one month. However, both the SP 500 and the Nasdaq 100 made new highs by August 2020. Phases of a Bear Market Bear markets usually have four different phases. First Phase of a Bear Market The first phase is characterized by high prices and high investor sentiment . Towards the end of this phase, investors begin to drop out of the markets and take in profits. Second Phase of a Bear Market In the second phase, stock prices begin to fall sharply, trading activity and corporate profits begin to drop, and economic indicators, that may have once been positive, start to become below average. Some investors begin to panic as sentiment starts to fall. This is referred to as capitulation . Third Phase of a Bear Market The third phase shows speculators start to enter the market, consequently raising some prices and trading volume. Fourth Phase of a Bear Market In the fourth and last phase, stock prices continue to drop, but slowly. As low prices and good news starts to attract investors again, bear markets start to lead to bull markets . Bear and Bull The bear market phenomenon is thought to get its name from the way in which a bear attacks its preyswiping its paws downward. This is why markets with falling stock prices are called bear markets. Just like the bear market, the bull market may be named after the way in which the bull attacks by thrusting its horns up into the air. Bear Markets vs. Corrections A bear market should not be confused with a correction, which is a short-term trend that has a duration of fewer than two months. While corrections offer a good time for value investors to find an entry point into stock markets, bear markets rarely provide suitable points of entry. This barrier is because it is almost impossible to determine a bear markets bottom. Trying to recoup losses can be an uphill battle unless investors are short sellers or use other strategies to make gains in falling markets. Between 1900 and 2018, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA had approximately 33 bear markets, averaging one every three years. One of the most notable bear markets in recent history coincided with the global financial crisis occurring between October 2007 and March 2009. During that time the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA declined 54. The global COVID-19 pandemic caused the most recent 2020 bear market for the SP 500 and DJIA. The Nasdaq Composite most recently entered a bear market in March 2022 on fears surrounding war in Ukraine, economic sanctions against Russia, and high inflation. Short Selling in Bear Markets Investors can make gains in a bear market by short selling . This technique involves selling borrowed shares and buying them back at lower prices. It is an extremely risky trade and can cause heavy losses if it does not work out. A short seller must borrow the shares from a broker before a short sell order is placed. The short sellers profit and loss amount is the difference between the price where the shares were sold and the price where they were bought back, referred to as covered. For example, an investor shorts 100 shares of a stock at 94. The price falls and the shares are covered at 84. The investor pockets a profit of 10 x 100 1,000. If the stock trades higher unexpectedly, the investor is forced to buy back the shares at a premium, causing heavy losses. Warning Short selling is a risky trading strategy with the possibility for high losses. It is not suitable for inexperienced investors. Puts and Inverse ETFs in Bear Markets A put option gives the owner the freedom, but not the responsibility, to sell a stock at a specific price on, or before, a certain date. Put options can be used to speculate on falling stock prices, and hedge against falling prices to protect long-only portfolios. Investors must have options privileges in their accounts to make such trades. Outside of a bear market, buying puts is generally safer than short selling . Inverse ETFs are designed to change values in the opposite direction of the index they track. For example, the inverse ETF for the SP 500 would increase by 1 if the SP 500 index decreased by 1. There are many leveraged inverse ETFs that magnify the returns of the index they track by two and three times. Like options, inverse ETFs can be used to speculate or protect portfolios. Tips For Retiring In A Bear Market Real-World Examples of Bear Markets The ballooning housing mortgage default crisis caught up with the stock market in October 2007. Back then, the SP 500 had touched a high of 1,565.15 on October 9, 2007. By March 5, 2009, it had crashed to 682.55, as the extent and ramifications of housing mortgage defaults on the overall economy became clear. The U.S. major market indexes were again close to bear market territory on December 24, 2018, falling just shy of a 20 drawdown. Most recently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went into a bear market on March 11, 2020, and the SP 500 entered a bear market on March 12, 2020. This followed the longest bull market on record for the index, which started in March 2009. Stocks were driven down by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic , which brought with it mass lockdowns and the fear of depressed consumer demand. During this period, the Dow Jones fell sharply from all-time highs close to 30,000 to lows below 19,000 in a matter of weeks. From February 19 to March 23, the SP 500 declined 34. Other examples include the aftermath of the bursting of the dot com bubble in March 2000, which wiped out approximately 49 of the SP 500s value and lasted until October 2002 and the Great Depression which began with the stock market collapse of October 28-29, 1929. Whats the Main Difference Between a Bear Market and a Bull Market? The main difference between a bear market and a bull market is that a bear market refers to a major downturn in financial markets, while a bull market refers to a major upswing. Markets are doing well during a bull market and poorly during a bear market. Is It Good To Buy During a Bear Market? Long-term investors can find many valuable stocks at lower prices during a bear market, making bear markets a good time to buy if you can afford to wait to see your investments rebound. Traders looking to make a short-term profit may need to use other strategies during a bear market, such as short selling. Should I Sell My Stocks During a Bear Market? For most investors, a buy-and-hold strategy is the best way to make money through investing, rather than rushing to buy or sell investments every time the market changes. If you have a balanced, diversified portfolio that includes assets such as government bonds, defensive stocks, and cash, as well as equities, you shouldnt need to sell during a bear market. Indeed, if you sell your stocks during a bear market because you are afraid of them dropping further, you may miss out on substantial profits when the market eventually rebounds. The Bottom Line A bear market is a downward trend in financial markets, indicating a weakening economy and a loss of investor confidence. Generally, a market is considered a bear market when prices have declined more than 20. Bear markets can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a several years. Buy-and-hold investors can often take advantage of lower prices during a bear market to add valuable stocks to their portfolios. Day traders and other short-term investors, though, may need to use strategies such as short selling, put options, and inverse ETFs to make a profit during a bear market.",

    "text": "Definition The stock market consists of a primary market where businesses first issue shares to investors and a secondary market where investors trade shares. What Is the Stock Market? The stock market is a broad term for the network of exchanges, brokerages, and over-the-counter venues where investors buy and sell shares in publicly traded companies. Though people sometimes use stock market to refer to the New York Stock Exchange NYSE or the Nasdaq , these exchanges are components of a wider global marketplace. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission regulates companies that want to sell shares to the public. Businesses must register with the SEC and publish periodic disclosures and financial statements. Key Takeaways Companies issue shares on the stock market to raise capital and expand their business. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was created to govern securities transactions on the secondary market. Investors may buy shares to receive dividends, vote in corporate elections, or sell shares at a higher price. Ellen Lindner Investopedia How the Stock Market Works When people refer to the stock market, they often refer to a specific exchange, like the New York Stock Exchange. But the stock market is a larger system of exchanges, brokerages, and over-the-counter markets Anywhere you can buy part of a company is part of the stock market. In this vast, complex network of trading activities, shares of companies are bought and sold, protected by laws against fraud and other unfair trading practices. The stock market plays a crucial role in modern economies by enabling money to move between investors and companies. People purchase stocks for a lot of reasons. Some hold onto shares, looking for income from dividends. Others look for low-priced stocks that are likely to gain value, so that they can sell at a profit. Still, others might be interested in having a say in how particular companies are run. Thats because you can vote at shareholder meetings based on the number of shares you own. Owning shares gives you the right to part of the companys profits, often paid as dividends, and sometimes the right to vote on company matters. Sometimes the best way to see how something works is to look at its parts. In that light, lets review the major elements of the stock market, from the companies selling shares to stocks to exchanges to the indexes that give us a snapshot of the stock markets health What Are Public Companies? Not all companies can offer stock to the public. In the U.S., only companies that are registered with the SEC can sell their shares on a public exchange like the NYSE or Nasdaq. These companies must meet stringent regulations and financial disclosure laws. The traditional route to going public is via an initial public offering IPO. In the 2020s, special purpose acquisition companies SPACs have emerged as an alternative route for going public . The primary market consists of those who buy their shares directly from the company, such as early investors, company insiders, and, for companies going public, financial underwriters . It also includes private placements , where a company sells its shares directly to investors without going through the registration process. Once a company goes public, its stock can be traded in the secondary market via exchanges or over the counter. More than 58,000 companies worldwide are publicly traded today. Stocks Buying and Selling Shares When you buy a stock or a share, youre getting a piece of that company. How much of the company you own depends on the number of shares the company has issued and the number of shares you own. If its a small, private company, a single share could represent a large part of the company. Major public companies often have millions, even billions, of shares. For example, Apple Inc. AAPL has billions of shares in circulation, so a single share is just a tiny fraction of the company. The price of a stock changes based on the demand for shares from new investors who want to buy, or the supply of shares from existing investors who want to sell. Not every investor makes decisions based on the same criteria, and what might seem like a high price to one investor is a bargain to another. This dynamic keeps shares trading hands and makes future prices difficult to predict. What Is a Stock Exchange? Once a company goes public, its shares can be traded freely on the stock market. This means that investors can buy and sell shares among themselves. Most trading occurs on stock exchanges, although there are other venues for trading. Stock exchanges are organized and regulated places today its mostly virtual where stocks and other securities are bought and sold. They play a crucial role in the financial system by providing a platform for companies to raise money by selling their stocks and bonds to the public. The NYSE and Nasdaq are prime examples, serving as central locations for buying and selling stocks. There are many other major exchanges worldwide, such as the London Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Each exchange has its own internal rules, and investors follow different national and local laws. These are meant to ensure fair trading practices and to keep investors confident in dealing there. They also provide transparency in the trading process, giving real-time information on securities prices. A major benefit of trading on stock exchanges is liquidity , the ability to buy or sell stocks relatively easily. With thousands of buyers and sellers, there is always someone willing to buy or sell shares for the right price. Many stock exchanges cross-list company shares, offering securities listed on other exchanges. This allows companies to reach more investors when raising capital, and gives investors a wider range of trading options. Fast Fact Though it is called a stock market, other securities, such as exchange-traded funds ETFs, are also traded there. Over-the-Counter Market Stocks can also be traded over the counter OTC. These OTC markets are where you buy or sell stocks directly with another investor, typically without the same level of regulation or public scrutiny. OTC trading involves a network of brokers and dealers who negotiate directly over computer networks and by phone. This type of trading is commonly used for smaller, less liquid companies that may not meet the stringent listing requirements of the stock exchanges. This can make it more challenging for investors to get reliable information about the companies they are investing in. Other Assets Sold on the Stock Market In addition to common stocks, many other assets are traded on stock exchanges and OTC. These are also considered part of the stock market American depositary receipts These represent shares in foreign companies and are traded on U.S. stock exchanges. They let U.S. investors invest in foreign companies without dealing with foreign stock exchanges or converting their currency. Derivatives This is a broad category that includes options and futures, whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indexes. So, in derivatives trading, youre not directly buying or selling the actual asset like the stock. Instead, youre trading something whose value is influenced by the changes in the price of an underlying asset. Funds These include mutual funds, which pool money from many investors for a basket of stocks, bonds, and other securities, and exchange-traded funds, which trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks and track or try to mirror how a sector, index, or theme of stocks is doing. Preferred stocks These stocks generally provide a set dividend and, as the name suggests, have priority over common stock in getting a share of the profits or whats left over if the company goes bankrupt. Real estate investment trusts REITs These are worth mentioning to get an idea of the breadth of what counts as the stock market. REITs are companies that own, manage, or finance real estate. Investors can buy shares in them, and they legally must provide 90 of their profits as dividends each year. More loosely, while separate markets, people often talk about these as part of the stock market Bonds These represent debt, and governments and corporations issue them to raise capital. Investors who buy bonds effectively lend money to the issuer in exchange for interest payments and the return of the bonds face value at maturity. Commodities There are 50 major commodities exchanges worldwide where you can buy raw materials like oil, steel, wheat, and coal directly or buy futures contracts based on where their prices might go. Investors and Traders Those in the stock market include institutional investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds, that manage large amounts of money and often have a significant influence over the market since they are trading in large volumes. Retail investors buy and sell securities for their accounts, not for an organization. They can range from beginners to experienced traders, and today, most use online platforms. Another key group is accredited investors, high-net-worth individuals with the money and investing experience, so the SEC allows them access to more complex investments, like venture capital and private equity. Generally speaking, investors approach the market from a long-term perspective. They put money in stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, expecting their value to grow over time these are not the quick trades you see in movies to get in and out fast. These investors are often more concerned with the fundamental strength of the companies or assets they invest in, such as their financial performance, market position, and growth potential. They decide on investments after research and analysis or after getting recommendations from financial advisors while trying to build wealth steadily through a portfolio that increases in value over time. Traders, for their part, take a more short-term approach to the stock market. They aim to capitalize on the markets volatility, trading stocks, options, futures, and other financial instruments within shorter time framesfrom seconds and minutes to days and months. Traders often rely on technical analysis, which involves studying market trends, charts, and other statistical measures to predict future price movements. While trading can offer the potential for quick profits, it also comes with higher risks than long-term investing. Quickly buying and selling securities requires a sharp understanding of the market and a more active, hands-on strategy for trading. Role of Brokers Brokers in the stock market play the same role as in insurance and elsewhere, acting as a go-between for investors and the securities markets. They are licensed organizations that buy and sell stocks and other securities for individual and institutional clients. Brokerage firms can be small boutique shops or multinationals offering investment advice, research, and wealth management services while executing trades for customers. Full-service brokers provide detailed financial advice, portfolio management, and personalized services, making them better for investors who prefer a thorough approach to managing their investments. Further down in cost, discount brokers provide a more hands-off experience and are typically preferred by investors who make their own trading decisions. Online brokerage firms have become increasingly popular with user-friendly platforms that allow investors to trade securities electronically at lower costs and with more convenience. These platforms often have educational resources, analytical tools, and real-time market data. There has also been a rise in robo-advisors , automated financial planning services offered at a very low price. Whatever type of broker, they are all regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA in the U.S. Regulators A significant aspect of the stock marketdictating whats traded and howis the regulations and regulators involved. In the U.S., the latter is the SEC, an independent federal agency set up in 1934 on the heels of the 1929 market crash and the travails of the Great Depression. The mission of the SEC is protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. The SEC enforces laws against market manipulation, insider trading, and other forms of fraud while verifying that public companies reveal any significant financial information investors should know when trusting a firm with their money by buying its stock. The SEC also oversees stock exchanges, broker-dealers, investment advisors, mutual funds, and public utility holding companies. In addition, the exchanges have their own requirements, such as filing timely usually quarterly updates to company financial reports and instant reporting of relevant corporate developments to ensure that everyone looking to trade has the same information. FINRA oversees brokerage firms and their registered securities representatives and is more focused than the SEC on protecting retail investors. Similar agencies exist worldwide, which is crucial given how the stock market is global and a calamity in one corner of the world soon reaches the otherits not just something that happens from a few buildings on Wall Street. While many countries regulations differ significantlythey answer to diverse populations and cultural expectationsgeneral rules are enforced to ensure fair practices, protect investors, and promote confidence in the broader stock market. How Stock Prices Are Determined Textbook descriptions of stock prices tend to start off talking about investors and dealers coming together, and for there to be a stock trade, the buyer and seller must agree on a figure. But most investors find prices as they are listed in online brokerage accounts or online graphs of stock prices over time, not as coming from tough negotiations. That said, you do have to agree to buy stocks, and each investor or trader making this decision collectively shapes the demand for stocks, which, taken against the supply on hand in the market, produces the prices on our screens. The factors that influence these prices fall into two main types fundamental and technical. Fundamental factors are rooted in a companys earnings, profitability from its operations, and the goods or services it offers. Meanwhile, technical factors relate to market sentiment and statistical analyses of historical market activity and stock price trends. High stock prices can indicate a companys successor at least the feeling of buyers that they are doing wellbut they can also result from stock splits, dividends, and share repurchases. When a stock price drops, this doesnt mean that money is lost from the market as a whole. Instead, it signifies a decrease in the market value of the specific stock. For instance, if a company reports higher profits than expected, its stock price might increase as more investors want to buy shares, hoping for future growth. Similarly, economic events like interest rate changes or geopolitical issues can affect investor confidence and stock prices. Market Indexes Most Americans first learn about the stock market through indexes, since reporting on the ups and downs of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA or SP 500 has long been a staple for financial news. Indexes can include the DJIA, which includes 30 large publicly owned companies, or the the SP 500, representing the 500 largest U.S. public companies. These indexes can give a picture of the wider stock market, or a specific sector like technology, or healthcare. Indexes are important since they are used as benchmarks for stocks and portfolios. For example, if youre invested in technology stocks, youll want to see how your stocks are doing against a tech index. Roles of the Stock Market The stock market fills several different roles Corporate governance Publicly traded companies follow stringent reporting regulations, which makes them far more transparent and accountable. This information allows investors to make informed decisions and helps maintain investor confidence in the market. Its also a boon for everyday Americans to gain a view inside major U.S. corporations since, without these transparency requirements, they could close down much of what we know about them. Economic indicator The stock markets performance is often considered a gauge of an economys health. Rising stock prices are associated with corporate profitability and economic growth, while declining prices signal problems ahead. Investment opportunities The stock market offers the chance to invest in companies and potentially grow a portfolio over time. The stock market has historically delivered returns outpacing inflation, making it a vital tool for retirement planning, wealth building, and financial security. Liquidity The stock market enables investors to buy and sell shares of companies and other securities quickly when needed. Raising capital Most importantly, the stock market offers a platform where companies raise funds by issuing stocks. This capital is essential for business expansion, research and development, and other corporate initiatives. By selling shares to the public, companies gain access to these funds without incurring debt. Resource allocation By reflecting the collective judgment of traders and investors through the price of different companies, the stock market is said to help efficiently distribute capital to companies more likely to succeed and away from those that are not. Why Is the Stock Market So Important? Now that we know the different parts of the stock marketwho, what, where, and how it workswe can better understand why its such a large part of our economy today. The meaning of the stock market cant be understated for how our world functions. When the earliest stock markets formed, the global economy was vastly different. These were eras when trade and commerce were primarily driven by physical goods, with industries like agriculture, textiles, and early manufacturing dominating the economic landscape. Stock markets at the time were fledgling institutions, primarily helping to finance expeditions and trade ventures. In other words, they were used to fund the colonial enterprises taking goods and people from South Asia, the Americas, and Africa. These stock exchanges were already global investment operations. Yet, they played a relatively minor role in everyday economic life. Fast forward to today, and the stock market is considered central to the global economy, a change underscored by financialization and the increasing dominance of financial markets and institutions. This isnt just because over a million Americans work in finance. Modern economies are characterized by a complex web of financial transactions and instruments, with the stock market not just a barometer for economic health but also seen as critical for distributing and creating wealth. The Meaning of the Stock Market for Most Americans Financialization has also mirrored broader socioeconomic changes. Todays stock markets are not just platforms for raising capital but have been tied into millions of Americans retirement and investment strategies. Many Americans are not directly invested in the stock market, but are still affected by its movements. First, the market drives funding for technological advances like smartphones and medications, which require billions of dollars for research and development. Market moves can also influence corporate decisions, influencing job creation and layoffs. A healthy stock market generally correlates with a more robust economy. But it could also mean more capital in the hands of a wealthy few, increasing the property values of once middle-class areas in almost every major American city. The stock market also indirectly influences public services and infrastructure. Pension funds are significantly invested in the stock market, affecting the retirement security of millions of people. Many more individuals dont have pensions and are invested in the market directly through 401ks and individual retirement accounts. Whats the Difference Between the Bond Market and the Stock Market? The bond market is where investors buy and sell debt securities, typically issued by governments or corporations. When you invest in bonds, youre essentially lending money for regular interest payments and the return on the bonds face value at maturity. The stock market involves buying and selling shares of publicly traded companies. Stocks offer the potential for higher returns than bonds since investors can get both dividends when the company is profitable and returns when the stock price goes up. They also have a higher risk, as stock prices can be more volatile. What Is an Alternate Trading System? Alternative trading systems are platforms for matching large buy and sell transactions and are not regulated like exchanges. Dark pools and many cryptocurrency exchanges are private exchanges or forums for securities and currency trading and run within private groups. Who Helps an Investor Trade on the Stock Market? Stockbrokers act as intermediaries between the stock exchanges and the investors by buying and selling stocks. Portfolio managers are professionals who invest portfolios, or collections of securities, for clients. Investment bankers represent companies in many ways, such as helping private companies go public or planning mergers and acquisitions. The Bottom Line The stock market is where shares of companies and other financial instruments are bought and sold. The stock market is also where companies raise capital and where investors can grow their wealth. Even if you dont trade on the stock market directly, it influences the products you buy, the type of jobs available, and the retirement you might plan.",

    "text": "Definition The bond market is a financial marketplace where various debt securities are issued and traded by governments and corporations to raise capital for operations and growth. What Is the Bond Market? The bond market is often referred to as the debt market, fixed-income market, or credit market . It is the collective name given to all trades and issues of debt securities . Governments issue bonds to raise capital to pay debts or fund infrastructural improvements. Publicly traded companies issue bonds to finance business expansion projects or maintain ongoing operations. Key Takeaways Governments use proceeds from bonds to finance infrastructural improvements and pay debts. Companies issue bonds to raise capital to maintain operations, grow product lines, or open new locations. Bonds are either issued on the primary market or traded on the secondary market, in which investors may purchase existing debt via brokers or other third parties. Investopedia Danie Drankwalter History of the Bond Markets Loans that were assignable or transferrable to others appeared as early as ancient Mesopotamia, where debts denominated in units of grain weight could be exchanged among debtors. The recorded history of debt instruments dates back to 2400 B.C. via a clay tablet discovered at Nippur, now present-day Iraq. This artifact cites a guarantee for payment of grain and the consequences if the debt was not repaid. In the middle ages, governments issued sovereign debt to fund wars. The Bank of England , the worlds oldest central bank, was established to raise money to rebuild the British navy in the 17th century through bonds. The first U.S. Treasury bonds were issued to help fund the military, first in the war of independence from the British crown, and again in the form of Liberty Bonds to raise funds to fight World War I. A bond from the Dutch East India Company VOC, dating from Nov. 7, 1623. The VOC was the first company in history to widely issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. Early chartered corporations such as the Dutch East India Company VOC and the Mississippi Company issued debt instruments before they issued stocks. These bonds, such as in the image above, were guarantees or sureties and were hand-written to the bondholder. Buying and Trading Bonds Bonds are traded on the primary market and the secondary market. The primary market is the new issues market, and transactions occur directly between the bond issuers and the bond buyers. This offering is known as the primary distribution . The primary market holds brand-new debt securities not previously offered to the public. In the secondary market , securities previously sold in the primary market are bought and sold. Investors can purchase these bonds from a broker, who acts as an intermediary between the buying and selling parties. These secondary market issues may be packaged as pension funds , mutual funds, and life insurance policies. Types of Bonds Corporate Bonds Companies issue corporate bonds to raise money for current operations, expanding product lines, or opening up new manufacturing facilities. Corporate bonds are commonly longer-term debt instruments with a maturity of at least one year and are commonly categorized into two types based on the credit rating assigned to the bond and its issuer. Investment grade signifies a high-quality bond that presents a relatively low risk of default. Bond-rating firms like Standard Poors and Moodys use different designations, consisting of the upper- and lower-case letters A and B, to identify a bonds credit quality rating. Junk bonds or high-yield bonds carry a higher risk. Junk bonds represent bonds issued by companies that are financially struggling and have a high risk of defaulting , not paying their interest payments, or repaying the principal to investors. Junk bonds are also called high-yield bonds since the higher yield is needed to help offset any risk of default. Government Bonds Nationally-issued government bonds or sovereign bonds entice buyers by paying out the face value listed on the bond certificate on the agreed maturity date with periodic interest payments. This makes government bonds attractive to conservative investors and considered the least risky. In the U.S., government bonds are known as Treasuries and the most active and liquid bond market. Treasury Bill T-Bill a short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less Treasury note T-note a marketable U.S. government debt security with a fixed interest rate and a maturity between one and ten years Treasury bonds T-bonds government debt securities issued by the U.S. Federal government with maturities greater than 20 years Important In August 2023, Fitch Ratings downgraded the long-term ratings of the United States to AA from AAA based on the expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to AA and AAA peers over the last two decades with repeated debt limit standoffs and untimely resolutions. Municipal Bonds Municipal bonds or muni bonds are locally issued by states, cities, special-purpose districts, public utility districts, school districts, publicly owned airports and seaports, and other government-owned entities that seek to raise cash to fund various projects. Municipal bonds are commonly tax-free at the federal level and can be tax-exempt at state or local tax levels, making them attractive to qualified tax-conscious investors. A general obligation bond GO bond is issued by government entities not backed by revenue from a specific project. Some GO bonds are backed by property taxes or payable from general funds. A revenue bond secures principal and interest payments through sales, fuel, hotel occupancy, or other taxes. When a municipality is a conduit issuer of bonds, a third party covers interest and principal payments. Mortgage-Backed Bonds MBS Mortgage-backed security MBS issues consist of pooled mortgages on real estate properties. The investor who buys a mortgage-backed security is essentially lending money to homebuyers through their lenders. These typically pay monthly interest. The MBS is a type of asset-backed security ABS . During the subprime mortgage meltdown of 2007-2010, this type of security relied on failed mortgages to support it. Emerging Market Bonds Governments and companies in emerging market economies issue bonds that provide growth opportunities but with greater risk than domestic or developed bond markets. In the 1980s, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady began a program to help global economies restructure their debt via bond issues denominated in U.S. dollars. Many countries in Latin America issued these Brady bonds throughout the next two decades, marking an upswing in the issuance of emerging market debt. Bonds are issued in developing nations and by corporations in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Investing in emerging market bonds includes the standard risks that accompany all debt issues , such as the variables of the issuers economic or financial performance and the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations. These risks can be heightened by the political and economic volatility in developing nations. Emerging market risks also include exchange rate fluctuations and currency devaluations. Bond Indices Just as the SP 500 and the Russell indices track equities , bond indices like the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index , the Merrill Lynch Domestic Master, and the Citigroup U.S. Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index track and measure corporate bond portfolio performance. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the Agg, is a market-weighted benchmark index. It provides investors with a standard against which they can evaluate a fund or security. The index includes government and corporate bonds and investment-grade corporate debt instruments with issues higher than 300 million and maturities of one year or more. The Agg is a total return benchmark index for many bond funds and exchange-traded funds ETFs . Bond Market vs. Stock Market Bonds represent debt financing, while stocks are equity financing. Bonds are a form of credit where the bond issuer must repay the bond owners principal plus additional interest. Stocks do not entitle the shareholder to any return of capital. Because of their legal protections and guarantees, bonds are typically less risky than stocks and command lower expected returns than stocks. Stocks are inherently riskier than bonds and have the potential for bigger gains or bigger losses. Both stock and bond markets tend to be very active and liquid. Bond prices tend to be sensitive to interest rate changes, varying inversely to interest rate moves. Stock prices are sensitive to changes in future profitability and growth potential. Tip Investors without access to bond markets can still invest in bonds through bond-focused mutual funds and ETFs. Advantages and Disadvantages of Bonds Financial experts commonly recommend a well-diversified portfolio with some allocation to the bond market. Bonds can be less volatile than stocks with lower returns and carry credit and interest rate risk. Owning too many bonds is considered overly conservative over long time horizons. Pros Less risky and less volatile than stocks. Wide range of issuers and bond types to choose from. Bondholders have preference over shareholders in the event of bankruptcy. Cons Lower risk translates to lower return. Buying bonds in the primary market is less accessible for ordinary investors. Exposure to default risk and interest rate risk. What Is the Bond Market and How Does It Work? The bond market is where various debt instruments are sold by corporations and governments. Bonds are issued to raise debt capital to fund operations or seek growth opportunities. Issuers promise to repay the original investment amount plus interest. Are Bonds a Good Investment? Like any investment, the expected return of a bond must be weighed against its risk. The riskier the issuer, the higher the yield investors will demand. Junk bonds pay higher interest rates but are also at greater risk of default. U.S. Treasuries pay very low-interest rates but have low risk. Can Investors Lose Money in the Bond Market? Yes. While not as risky as stocks, bond prices fluctuate and can go down. If interest rates rise, the price of a highly-rated bond will decrease. The sensitivity of a bonds price to interest rate changes is known as its duration . A bond will also lose significant value if its issuer defaults or goes bankrupt, and it can no longer repay in full the initial investment nor the interest owed. The Bottom Line The bond market includes debt securities issued by governments and corporations, both domestic and foreign. Bonds may also be structured with fixed or variable interest rates and may or may not be convertible into equity. Bonds are typically thought to be less volatile than stocks since they pay regular interest and return principal upon maturity.",

Derivatives can take many forms, from stock and bond derivatives to economic indicator derivatives . Traders may use derivatives to access specific markets and trade different assets. Typically, derivatives are considered a form of advanced investing. The most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds, commodities , currencies , interest rates , and market indexes . Contract values depend on changes in the prices of the underlying assetthe primary instrument . Derivatives can be used to hedge, speculate on the directional movement of an underlying asset, or leverage a position. These assets are commonly traded on exchanges or OTC, and can often be entered via an online broker . The Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME is among the worlds largest derivatives exchanges. Its important to remember that when companies hedge, theyre not speculating on the price of the commodity. Instead, the hedge is an attempt to limit existing risks. Each party has its profit or margin built into the price, and the hedge helps protect those profits from being eliminated by unfavorable market moves in the price of the underlying asset. OTC-traded derivatives generally carry a greater counterparty risk the danger that one of the parties involved in the transaction might not deliver on its obligations, or default . OTC contracts are privately negotiated between two counterparties and are unregulated. To hedge this risk, the investor could purchase a currency derivative to, for example, lock in a specific exchange rate. Derivatives that could be used to hedge forex risk include currency futures and currency swaps . Important Exchange-traded derivatives, such as options and futures, are standardized and more heavily regulated than those traded over the counter and can be freely bought and sold via most online brokers . Special Considerations Derivatives were originally used to ensure balanced exchange rates for internationally traded goods. International traders needed a system to account for the constantly changing values of national currencies . Assume a European investor has investment accounts that are all denominated in euros EUR. Lets say they purchase shares of a U.S. company through a U.S. exchange using U.S. dollars USD. This means they are now exposed to exchange rate risk while holding that stock. Exchange rate risk is the threat that the value of the euro will increase in relation to the USD. If this happens, any profits the investor realizes upon selling the stock become less valuable when they are converted back into euros. A speculator who expects the euro to appreciate vs. the dollar could profit by using a derivative that rises in value with the euro. When using derivatives to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset, the investor does not need to have the actual underlying asset in their portfolio . Fast Fact Many derivative instruments are leveraged, which means a small amount of capital is required to have a sizable position in the underlying asset. Types of Derivatives Derivatives today are based on a wide variety of underlying assets and have many uses, even exotic ones. For example, there are derivatives based on weather data, such as the amount of rain or the number of sunny days in a region. There are different types of derivatives that can be used for risk management , speculation , and leveraging a position. The derivatives market continues to grow, expanding with products to fit nearly any need or level of risk tolerance . There are two classes of derivative products lock and option . Lock products e.g., futures, forwards, or swaps bind the respective parties from the outset to the agreed-upon terms over the life of the contract. Option products e.g., stock options, on the other hand, offer the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset or security at a specific price on or before the options expiration date. The most common derivative types are futures, forwards, swaps, and options. Futures A futures contract , or simply futures, is an agreement between two parties for the purchase and delivery of an asset at an agreed-upon price at a future date. Futures are standardized contracts that trade on an exchange. Traders use futures to hedge their risk or speculate on the price of an underlying asset. The parties involved are obligated to fulfill a commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset. For example, say that on Nov. 6, 2025, Company A buys a futures contract for oil at a price of 62.22 per barrel that expires Dec. 19, 2025. The company does this because it needs oil in December and is concerned that the price will rise before the company needs to buy. Buying an oil futures contract hedges the companys risk because the seller is obligated to deliver oil to Company A for 62.22 per barrel once the contract expires. Assume oil prices rise to 80 per barrel by Dec. 19, 2025. Company A can accept delivery of the oil from the seller of the futures contract, but if it no longer needs the oil, it can also sell the contract before expiration and keep the profits. In this example, both the futures buyer and seller hedge their risk. Company A needed oil in the future and wanted to offset the risk that the price may rise in December with a long position in an oil futures contract. The seller could be an oil company concerned about falling oil prices that wanted to eliminate that risk by selling or shorting a futures contract that fixed the price it would get in December. It is also possible that one or both of the parties are speculators with the opposite opinions about the price of oil in December. In that case, one might benefit from the contract, and one might not. Take, for example, the futures contract for West Texas Intermediate WTI oil that trades on the CME and represents 1,000 barrels of oil. If the price of oil rose from 62.22 to 80 per barrel, the trader with the long positionthe buyerin the futures contract would have profited 17,780 80 - 62.22 1,000 17,780. The trader with the short positionthe sellerin the contract would have a loss of 17,780. Cash Settlements of Futures Not all futures contracts are settled at expiration by delivering the underlying asset. If both parties in a futures contract are speculating investors or traders , it is unlikely that either of them would want to make arrangements for the delivery of a large number of barrels of crude oil. Speculators can end their obligation to purchase or deliver the underlying commodity by closing unwinding their contract before expiration with an offsetting contract. Many derivatives are, in fact, cash-settled , which means that the gain or loss in the trade is simply an accounting cash flow to the traders brokerage account. Futures contracts that are cash-settled include many interest rate futures, stock index futures , and more unusual instruments such as volatility futures or weather futures . Forwards Forward contracts , or forwards, are similar to futures, but they do not trade on an exchange. These contracts only trade over the counter. When a forward contract is created, the buyer and seller may customize the terms, size, and settlement process. As OTC products, forward contracts carry a greater degree of counterparty risk. Counterparty risks are a type of credit risk where the parties involved may fail to deliver on the obligations outlined in the contract. If one party becomes insolvent, the other party may have no recourse and could lose the value of its position. Once created, the parties in a forward contract can offset their positions with other counterparties, which can increase the potential for counterparty risks as more traders become involved in the same contract. Swaps Swaps are another common type of derivatives, often used to exchange one kind of cash flow for another. For example, a trader might use an interest rate swap to switch from a variable interest rate loan to a fixed-interest-rate loan, or vice versa. Imagine that Company XYZ borrows 1,000,000 and pays a variable interest rate on the loan that is currently 6. XYZ may be concerned about rising interest rates that will increase the costs of this loan or encounter a lender that is reluctant to extend more credit while the company has this variable-rate risk. Assume XYZ creates a swap with Company QRS, which is willing to exchange the payments owed on the variable-rate loan for the payments owed on a fixed-rate loan of 7. That means that XYZ will pay 7 to QRS on its 1,000,000 principal, and QRS will pay XYZ 6 interest on the same principal. At the beginning of the swap, XYZ will just pay QRS the 1-percentage-point difference between the two swap rates . If interest rates fall so that the variable rate on the original loan is now 5, Company XYZ will have to pay Company QRS the 2-percentage-point difference on the loan. If interest rates rise to 8, then QRS would have to pay XYZ the 1-percentage-point difference between the two swap rates. Regardless of how interest rates change, the swap has achieved XYZs original objective of turning a variable-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan. Swaps can also be constructed to exchange currency risk or the risk of default on a loan or cash flows from other business activities. Swaps related to the cash flows and potential defaults of mortgage bonds are an extremely popular derivative. In fact, theyve been a bit too popular in the past. It was the counterparty risk of swaps like this that eventually spiraled into the credit crisis of 2008 . Options An options contract is similar to a futures contract in that it is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date for a specific price. The key difference between options and futures is that with an option, the buyer is not obliged to exercise their agreement to buy or sell. It is an opportunity only, not an obligation, as futures are. As with futures, options may be used to hedge or speculate on the price of the underlying asset. Tip In terms of timing your right to buy or sell, it depends on the style of the option. An American-style option allows holders to exercise the option rights anytime before and including the day of expiration. A European-style option can be executed only on the day of expiration. Most stocks and exchange-traded funds ETFs have American-style options, while equity indexes, including the SP 500, have European-style options. Imagine an investor owns 100 shares of a stock worth 50 per share. They believe the stocks value will rise in the future. However, this investor is concerned about potential risks and decides to hedge their position with an option. The investor could buy a put option that gives them the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock for 50 per shareknown as the strike price until a specific day in the futureknown as the expiration date . The option costs 2 per share. Each option contract represents 100 shares, so the investor paid 200 to enter this trade. Assume the stock falls in value to 40 per share by expiration and the put option buyer decides to exercise their option and sell the stock for the original strike price of 50 per share. As such, the investor only lost 200the price he paid for the options. An unhedged position wouldve shown a loss of 1,000. A strategy like this is called a protective put because it hedges the stocks downside risk. Alternatively, assume an investor doesnt own the stock currently worth 50 per share. They believe its value will rise over the next month. This investor could buy a call option that gives them the right to buy the stock for 50 before or at expiration. Assume this call option costs 2 per share, or 200 for the trade, and the stock rose to 60 before expiration. The buyer can now exercise their option and buy a stock worth 60 per share for the 50 strike price and record a gain of 10 per share. Subtracting 2 per share paid to enter the trade, and any broker fees, the investor is looking at approximately 800 net profit. In both examples, the sellers are obligated to fulfill their side of the contract if the buyers choose to exercise the contract. However, if a stocks price is above the strike price at expiration, the put option will be worthless and the seller the option writer gets to keep the premium at expiration. If the stocks price is below the strike price at expiration, the call will be worthless and the call seller will keep the premium. Melissa Ling Investopedia, 2019 Advantages and Disadvantages of Derivatives Advantages As the above examples illustrate, derivatives can be a useful tool for businesses and investors alike. They provide a way to Lock in prices Hedge against unfavorable movements in rates Mitigate risks These pluses can often come for a limited cost. Note Derivatives also can often be purchased on margin , which means traders use borrowed funds to purchase them. This makes them even less expensive. Disadvantages Derivatives can be difficult to value because they are based on the price of another asset. OTC derivatives also include counterparty risks that are difficult to predict. Additionally, most derivatives are sensitive to the following Changes in the amount of time until expiration Any costs associated with holding the underlying asset Interest rates These variables make it difficult to perfectly match the value of a derivative with the underlying asset. Because the derivative has no intrinsic valueits value comes only from the underlying assetit is vulnerable to market sentiment and market risks. Supply and demand factors can cause a derivatives price and its liquidity to rise and fall, regardless of what is happening with the price of the underlying asset. Finally, derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, and using leverage cuts both ways. While it can increase potential returns, it also makes losses mount quicker.

Derivatives are securities whose value is dependent on or derived from an underlying asset. For example, an oil futures contract is a type of derivative whose value is based on the market price of oil. Derivatives have become increasingly popular in recent decades, with the total value of derivatives outstanding estimated at 729.8 trillion on June 30, 2024. What Are Some Examples of Derivatives? Common examples of derivatives include futures contracts, options contracts, and credit default swaps . Beyond these, there is a vast quantity of derivative contracts tailored to meet the needs of a diverse range of counterparties. In fact, because many derivatives are traded over the counter OTC, they can in principle be infinitely customized. What Are the Main Benefits and Risks of Derivatives? Derivatives can be a very convenient way to achieve financial goals. For example, a company that wants to hedge against its exposure to commodities can do so by buying or selling energy derivatives such as crude oil futures. Similarly, a company could hedge its currency risk by purchasing currency-forward contracts. Derivatives can also help investors leverage their positions, such as by buying equities through stock options rather than shares. The main drawbacks of derivatives include counterparty risk, the inherent risks of leverage, and the fact that complicated webs of derivative contracts can lead to systemic risks . The Bottom Line A derivative is a type of financial contract that can be traded as an investment. Derivatives have no intrinsic value. Their worth comes entirely from the value of the underlying asset. Derivatives can be used to mitigate risk or to assume risk in the hope of achieving a reward. Regardless of your goal as an investor, derivatives come with potential downsides, including complexity, supply and demand factors, and vulnerability to market sentiment.",

    "text": "Definition Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, most often based on blockchain technology. What Is Cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technologya distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. Key Takeaways A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities. Some experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law. The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure. The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities. Investopedia Tara Anand Understanding Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. Crypto refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network. Every new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger. Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase Co. JPM are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing. Types of Cryptocurrency Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereums ether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether ETH inherited an additional duty as the blockchains staking mechanism. The XRP Ledger Foundations XRP is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies. Because there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market, its important to understand the types. Knowing whether the coin youre looking at has a purpose can help you decide whether it is worth investing in a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesnt have a use. Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coins name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types youll find with some of the names of tokens in that category Utility XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains. Transactional Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these. Governance These tokens represent voting or other rights on a blockchain, such as Uniswap. Platform These tokens support applications built to use a blockchain, such as Solana. Security tokens Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized value transferred to the blockchain. MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire. If you find a cryptocurrency that doesnt fall into one of these categories, youve found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure its legitimate. How to Buy Cryptocurrency If you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a cryptocurrency exchange . These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a digital wallet or use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your coins. If you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so through your brokerage . For example, Robinhood allows users to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, although you cannot withdraw them from the platform for purchases. In addition, there are several crypto ETFs that provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring the investors to maintain their own wallets. For instance, as of May 2024, investors may choose to hold Bitcoin futures ETF shares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares. Is Cryptocurrency Legal? Fiat currencies derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is legal tender. But cryptocurrencies are not issued by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. It doesnt help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure. In the U.S. The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force FATF recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance. Important Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service IRS treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assetseither as capital gains or ordinary incomedepends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it. In the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges. Enthusiasts called it a victory for crypto however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry. Fast Fact As of June 2024, El Salvador is the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions. In the rest of the world, cryptocurrency regulation varies by jurisdiction. In Asia Japans Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer. China has banned cryptocurrency exchanges , transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC . India was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies. In Europe Cryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as financial instruments. In June 2023, the European Commissions Markets in Crypto-Assets MiCA regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies. Is Cryptocurrency a Safe Investment? Cryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, the technical complexity of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users. In addition to the market risks associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks User risk Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. By some estimates, about one-fifth of all bitcoins are now inaccessible due to lost passwords or incorrect sending addresses. Regulatory risks The regulatory status of some cryptocurrencies is still unclear in many areas, with some governments seeking to regulate them as securities, currencies, or both. A sudden regulatory crackdown could make it challenging to sell cryptocurrencies or cause a market-wide price drop. Counterparty risks Many investors and merchants rely on exchanges or other custodians to store their cryptocurrency. Theft or loss by one of these third parties could result in losing ones entire investment. Management risks Due to the lack of coherent regulations, there are few protections against deceptive or unethical management practices. Many investors have lost large sums to management teams that failed to deliver a product. Programming risks Many investment and lending platforms use automated smart contracts to control the movement of user deposits. An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment. Market Manipulation Market manipulation remains a substantial problem in cryptocurrency, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges acting unethically. Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about 2.4 trillion. Despite the assets speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies. Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation. Advantages Removes single points of failure Easier to transfer funds between parties Removes third parties Can be used to generate returns Remittances are streamlined Disadvantages Transactions are pseudonymous Pseudonymity allows for criminal uses Have become highly centralized Expensive to participate in a network and earn Off-chain security issues Prices are very volatile Advantages Explained Cryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money . In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failuresuch as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S. Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized transfers are secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, such as proof of work or proof of stake . Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in decentralized finance are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading. The remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrencys most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement. Disadvantages Explained Though they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction , cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of Dread Pirate Roberts , who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities. In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in their funds. One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars. Fast Fact Only 61 1 of the 4,568 Bitcoin blocks opened from May 15, 2024, to June 15, 2024, were opened by unknown addresses. The other 99 were opened by mining pools. Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins. Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments require accurate price monitoring . For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly 65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over 20,000 a year and a half later. Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a speculative bubble . Is Crypto Actually a Good Investment? Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth. Is Crypto Real Money? One definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure or store of value, and a unit of account. By this definition, cryptocurrency is real money. How Does Crypto Make You Money? There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods are guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefitted from them. The Bottom Line Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to understand the risks involved before investing.

    "text": "Definition The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis releases Gross Domestic Product GDP figures quarterly and annually. What Is Gross Domestic Product GDP? Gross Domestic Product GDP includes consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investments. It functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a countrys economic health. GDP may be adjusted for inflation and population to provide deeper insights. Real GDP accounts for inflation, while Nominal GDP does not. Key Takeaways GDP helps measure the size of a countrys economy and its growth rate. The GDP growth rate compares the annual or quarterly change in a countrys economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing. GDP increases when a countrys exports exceed its imports. Inflation may rise as GDP grows due to strengthening demand or a reduction in supply. Zoe Hansen Investopedia Understanding Gross Domestic Product GDP The calculation of a countrys GDP encompasses all private and public consumption, government outlays, investments, additions to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreign balance of trade . Exports are added to the value, and imports are subtracted. Of all the components that make up a countrys GDP, the foreign balance of trade is especially important. The GDP of a country tends to increase when the total value of goods and services that domestic producers sell to foreign countries exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services that domestic consumers buy. When this situation occurs, a country is said to have a trade surplus . If the opposite situation occursthat is, if the amount that domestic consumers spend on foreign products is greater than the total sum of what domestic producers can sell to foreign consumersit is called a trade deficit . In this situation, the GDP of a country tends to decrease. GDP can be computed on a nominal basis or a real basis, the latter accounting for inflation . Overall, real GDP is a better method for expressing long-term national economic performance since it uses constant dollars . Lets say one country had a nominal GDP of 100 billion in 2014. By 2024, its nominal GDP grew to 150 billion. Prices also rose by 100 over the same period. In this example, if you look solely at its nominal GDP, the countrys economy appears to be performing well. However, the real GDP expressed in 2014 dollars would only be 75 billion, revealing that an overall decline in real economic performance actually occurred during this time. What Does GDP Tell You? A countrys GDP represents the final market value of all the products and services that a country produces in a single year. Another way to measure GDP is as the sum of four factors consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investment. In the United States, GDP is calculated every three months by the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA . The BEA makes its estimate based on price estimates, survey data, and other information collected by other agencies, such as the Census Bureau, Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Types of GDP GDP can be reported in several ways, each of which provides slightly different information. Nominal GDP Nominal GDP is an assessment of economic production in an economy that includes current prices in its calculation. In other words, it doesnt strip out inflation or the pace of rising prices, which can inflate the growth figure. All goods and services counted in nominal GDP are valued at the prices at which those goods and services are sold for in that year. Nominal GDP is evaluated in either the local currency or U.S. dollars at currency market exchange rates to compare countries GDPs in purely financial terms. Nominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year. When comparing the GDP of two or more years, real GDP is used. This is because, in effect, the removal of the influence of inflation allows the comparison of the different years to focus solely on volume. Real GDP Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the number of goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, with prices held constant from year to year to separate out the impact of inflation or deflation from the trend in output over time. Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods and services, it is subject to inflation. Rising prices tend to increase a countrys GDP, but this does not necessarily reflect any change in the quantity or quality of goods and services produced. Thus, by looking just at an economys nominal GDP, it can be difficult to tell whether the figure has risen because of a real expansion in production or simply because prices rose. Economists use a process that adjusts for inflation to arrive at an economys real GDP. By adjusting the output in any given year for the price levels that prevailed in a reference year, called the base year, economists can adjust for inflations impact. This way, it is possible to compare a countrys GDP from one year to another and see if there is any real growth. Real GDP is calculated using a GDP price deflator , which is the difference in prices between the current year and the base year. For example, if prices rose by 5 since the base year, then the deflator would be 1.05. Nominal GDP is divided by this deflator, yielding real GDP. Nominal GDP is usually higher than real GDP because inflation is typically a positive number. Real GDP accounts for changes in market value and thus narrows the difference between output figures from year to year. If there is a large discrepancy between a nations real GDP and nominal GDP, this may be an indicator of significant inflation or deflation in its economy. GDP Per Capita GDP per capita is a measurement of the GDP per person in a countrys population. It indicates that the amount of output or income per person in an economy can indicate average productivity or average living standards. GDP per capita can be stated in nominal, real inflation-adjusted, or purchasing power parity PPP terms. At a basic interpretation, per-capita GDP shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each citizen. This also translates to a measure of overall national wealth since GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure. Per-capita GDP is often analyzed alongside more traditional measures of GDP. Economists use this metric for insight into their own countrys domestic productivity and the productivity of other countries. Per-capita GDP considers both a countrys GDP and its population. Therefore, it can be important to understand how each factor contributes to the overall result and affects per-capita GDP growth. If a countrys per-capita GDP is growing with a stable population level, for example, it could be the result of technological progress that is producing more with the same population level. Some countries may have a high per-capita GDP but a small population, which usually means they have built up a self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources. GDP Growth Rate The GDP growth rate compares the year-over-year or quarterly change in a countrys economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing. Usually expressed as a percentage rate, this measure is popular for economic policymakers because GDP growth is thought to be closely connected to key policy targets such as inflation and unemployment rates. If GDP growth rates accelerate, it may be a signal that the economy is overheating, and the central bank may seek to raise interest rates. Conversely, central banks see a shrinking or negative GDP growth rate i.e., a recession as a signal that rates should be lowered and that stimulus may be necessary. GDP Purchasing Power Parity PPP While not directly a measure of GDP, economists look at PPP to see how one countrys GDP measures up in international dollars using a method that adjusts for differences in local prices and costs of living to make cross-country comparisons of real output, real income, and living standards. 3.1 The annual rate of increase for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of 2024. U.S. GDP recorded a 3.0 increase during the second quarter of 2024. GDP Formula GDP can be determined via three primary methods. All three methods should yield the same figure when correctly calculated. These three approaches are often termed the expenditure approach, the output or production approach, and the income approach. The Expenditure Approach The expenditure approach, also known as the spending approach, calculates spending by the different groups that participate in the economy. The U.S. GDP is primarily measured based on the expenditure approach. This approach can be calculated using the following formula GDP C G I NX where C Consumption G Government spending I Investment NX Net exports beginalignedtextGDP textC textG textI textNX textbfwhere textC textConsumption textG textGovernment spending textI textInvestment textNX textNet exports endaligned GDP C G I NX where C Consumption G Government spending I Investment NX Net exports All of these activities contribute to the GDP of a country. Consumption refers to private consumption expenditures or consumer spending. Consumers spend money to acquire goods and services, such as groceries and haircuts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP, accounting for more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP. Consumer confidence, therefore, has a very significant bearing on economic growth. A high confidence level indicates that consumers are willing to spend, while a low confidence level reflects uncertainty about the future and an unwillingness to spend. Government spending represents government consumption expenditure and gross investment. Governments spend money on equipment, infrastructure, and payroll. Government spending may become more important relative to other components of a countrys GDP when consumer spending and business investment both decline sharply. This may occur in the wake of a recession, for example. Investment refers to private domestic investment or capital expenditures. Businesses spend money to invest in their business activities. For example, a business may buy machinery. Business investment is a critical component of GDP since it increases the productive capacity of an economy and boosts employment levels. The net exports formula subtracts total exports from total imports NX Exports - Imports. The goods and services that an economy produces that are exported to other countries, less the imports that are purchased by domestic consumers, represent a countrys net exports. All expenditures by companies located in a given country, even if they are foreign companies, are included in this calculation. The Production Output Approach The production approach is essentially the reverse of the expenditure approach. Instead of measuring the input costs that contribute to economic activity, the production approach estimates the total value of economic output and deducts the cost of intermediate goods that are consumed in the process like those of materials and services. Whereas the expenditure approach projects forward from costs, the production approach looks backward from the vantage point of a state of completed economic activity. The Income Approach The income approach represents a kind of middle ground between the two other approaches to calculating GDP. The income approach calculates the income earned by all the factors of production in an economy, including the wages paid to labor, the rent earned by land, the return on capital in the form of interest, and corporate profits. The income approach factors in some adjustments for those items that are not considered payments made to factors of production. For one, there are some taxes, such as sales taxes and property taxes, that are classified as indirect business taxes. In addition, depreciation, which is a reserve that businesses set aside to account for the replacement of equipment that tends to wear down with use, is also added to the national income. All of this together constitutes a nations income. GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI Although GDP is a widely used metric, there are other ways of measuring the economic growth of a country. While GDP measures the economic activity within the physical borders of a country whether the producers are native to that country or foreign-owned entities, gross national product GNP is a measurement of the overall production of people or corporations native to a country, including those based abroad. GNP excludes domestic production by foreigners. Gross national income GNI is another measure of economic growth. It is the sum of all income earned by citizens or nationals of a country regardless of whether the underlying economic activity takes place domestically or abroad. The relationship between GNP and GNI is similar to the relationship between the production output approach and the income approach used to calculate GDP. GNP uses the production approach, while GNI uses the income approach. With GNI, the income of a country is calculated as its domestic income, plus its indirect business taxes and depreciation as well as its net foreign factor income. The figure for net foreign factor income is calculated by subtracting all payments made to foreign companies and individuals from all payments made to domestic businesses. In an increasingly global economy, GNI has been put forward as a potentially better metric for overall economic health than GDP. Because certain countries have most of their income withdrawn abroad by foreign corporations and individuals, their GDP figure is much higher than the figure that represents their GNI. For example, Luxembourg has a significant difference between its GDP and GNI, mainly due to large payments made to the rest of the world via foreign corporations that do business in Luxembourg, attracted by the tiny nations favorable tax laws. On the contrary, GNI and GDP in the U.S. do not differ substantially. U.S. GDP was 29,37 trillion as of Q3 2024, while its GNI was about 27,57 trillion by the end of 2023 latest available data. Adjustments to GDP Several adjustments can be made to a countrys GDP to improve the usefulness of this figure. For economists, a countrys GDP reveals the size of the economy but provides little information about the standard of living in that country. Part of the reason for this is that population size and cost of living are not consistent around the world. Economists can use tax-to-GDP to get a better understanding of how a nations tax revenue impacts its economy and its people. For example, comparing the nominal GDP of China to the nominal GDP of Ireland would not provide much meaningful information about the realities of living in those countries because China has approximately 300 times the population of Ireland. To help solve this problem, statisticians sometimes compare GDP per capita between countries. GDP per capita is calculated by dividing a countrys total GDP by its population, and this figure is frequently cited to assess the nations standard of living. Even so, the measure is still imperfect. Suppose China has a GDP per capita of 1,500, while Ireland has a GDP per capita of 15,000. This doesnt necessarily mean that the average Irish person is 10 times better off than the average Chinese person. GDP per capita doesnt account for how expensive it is to live in a country. PPP attempts to solve this problem by comparing how many goods and services an exchange-rate-adjusted unit of money can purchase in different countriescomparing the price of an item, or a basket of items, in two countries after adjusting for the exchange rate between the two, in effect. Real per-capita GDP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is a heavily refined statistic to measure true income, which is an important element of well-being. An individual in Ireland might make 100,000 a year, while an individual in China might make 50,000 a year. In nominal terms, the worker in Ireland is better off. But if a years worth of food, clothing, and other items costs three times as much in Ireland as in China, then the worker in China has a higher real income . How to Use GDP Data Most nations release GDP data every month and quarter. In the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA publishes an advance release of quarterly GDP four weeks after the quarter ends and a final release three months after the quarter ends. The BEA releases are exhaustive and contain a wealth of detail, enabling economists and investors to obtain information and insights on various aspects of the economy. GDPs market impact is generally limited since it is backward-looking, and a substantial amount of time has already elapsed between the quarter-end and GDP data release. However, GDP data can have an impact on markets if the actual numbers differ considerably from expectations. Because GDP provides a direct indication of the health and growth of the economy, businesses can use GDP as a guide to their business strategy. Government entities, such as the Fed in the U.S., use the growth rate and other GDP stats as part of their decision process in determining what type of monetary policies to implement. If the growth rate is slowing, they might implement an expansionary monetary policy to try to boost the economy. If the growth rate is robust, they might use monetary policy to slow things down to try to ward off inflation. Real GDP is the indicator that says the most about the health of the economy. It is widely followed and discussed by economists, analysts, investors, and policymakers. The advance release of the latest data will almost always move markets, although that impact can be limited, as noted above. GDP and Investing Investors watch GDP since it provides a framework for decision-making. The corporate profits and inventory data in the GDP report are a great resource for equity investors, as both categories show total growth during the period corporate profits data also displays pretax profits, operating cash flows , and breakdowns for all major sectors of the economy. Comparing the GDP growth rates of different countries can play a part in asset allocation, aiding decisions about whether to invest in fast-growing economies abroad and, if so, which ones. One interesting metric that investors can use to get a sense of the valuation of an equity market is the ratio of total market capitalization to GDP, expressed as a percentage. The closest equivalent to this in terms of stock valuation is a companys market cap to total sales or revenues, which in per-share terms is the well-known price-to-sales ratio . Just as stocks in different sectors trade at widely divergent price-to-sales ratios, different nations trade at market-cap-to-GDP ratios that are all over the map. For example, according to The World Bank, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of 156.5 for 2022 latest information, while China had a ratio of 64.1 and Hong Kong had a ratio of 1,273.2. However, the utility of this ratio lies in comparing it to historical norms for a particular nation. As an example, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of 141.6 at the end of 2006, which dropped to 78.5 by the end of 2008 during the financial crisis. In retrospect, these represented zones of substantial overvaluation and undervaluation, respectively, for U.S. equities. The biggest downside of this data is its lack of timeliness investors only get one update per quarter, and revisions can be large enough to significantly alter the percentage change in GDP. History of GDP The concept of GDP was first proposed in 1937 in a report to the U.S. Congress in response to the Great Depression, conceived of and presented by an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research NBER, Simon Kuznets. At the time, the preeminent system of measurement was GNP. After the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, GDP was widely adopted as the standard means for measuring national economies however, the U.S. continued to use GNP as its official measure of economic welfare until 1991, after which it switched to GDP. Beginning in the 1950s, however, some economists and policymakers began to question GDP. Some observed, for example, a tendency to accept GDP as an absolute indicator of a nations failure or success, despite its failure to account for health, happiness, inequality, and other constituent factors of public welfare. In other words, these critics drew attention to a distinction between economic progress and social progress. Most authorities, like Arthur Okun, an economist for President John F. Kennedys Council of Economic Advisers, held firm to the belief that GDP is an absolute indicator of economic success, claiming that for every increase in GDP, there would be a corresponding drop in unemployment. Criticisms of GDP There are, of course, drawbacks to using GDP as an indicator. In addition to the lack of timeliness, some criticisms of GDP as a measure are It ignores the value of informal or unrecorded economic activity. GDP relies on recorded transactions and official data, so it does not take into account the extent of informal economic activity. GDP fails to account for the value of under-the-table employment, underground market activity, or unremunerated volunteer work, which can all be significant in some nations and cannot account for the value of leisure time or household production, which are ubiquitous conditions of human life in all societies. It is geographically limited in a globally open economy. GDP does not take into account profits earned in a nation by overseas companies that are remitted back to foreign investors. This can overstate a countrys actual economic output. For example, Ireland had a GDP of 545.63 billion and GNI of 421.77 billion in 2023, which is a difference of about 123.86 billion or almost 23 of GDP largely being due to profit repatriation by foreign companies based in Ireland. It emphasizes material output without considering overall well-being. GDP growth alone cannot measure a nations development or its citizens well-being, as noted above. For instance, a nation may be experiencing rapid GDP growth, but this may impose a significant cost to society in terms of environmental impact and an increase in income disparity. It ignores business-to-business activity. GDP considers only final goods production and new capital investment and deliberately nets out intermediate spending and transactions between businesses. By doing so, GDP overstates the importance of consumption relative to production in the economy and is less sensitive as an indicator of economic fluctuations compared to metrics that include business-to-business activity. It counts costs and waste as economic benefits. GDP counts all final private and government spending as additions to income and output for society, regardless of whether they are productive or profitable. This means that obviously unproductive or even destructive activities are routinely counted as economic output and contribute to growth in GDP. For example, this includes spending directed toward extracting or transferring wealth between members of society rather than producing wealth such as the administrative costs of taxation or money spent on lobbying and rent seeking spending on investment projects for which the necessary complementary goods and labor are not available or for which actual consumer demand does not exist such as the construction of empty ghost cities or bridges to nowhere, unconnected to any road network and spending on goods and services that are either themselves destructive or only necessary to offset other destructive activities, rather than to create new wealth such as the production of weapons of war or spending on policing and anti-crime measures. Global Sources for Country GDP Data The World Bank hosts one of the most reliable web-based databases. It has one of the best and most comprehensive lists of countries for which it tracks GDP data. The International Money Fund IMF also provides GDP data through its multiple databases, such as the World Economic Outlook and International Financial Statistics. Another highly reliable source of GDP data is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD . The OECD not only provides historical data but also forecasts GDP growth. The disadvantage of using the OECD database is that it tracks only OECD member countries and a few nonmember countries. In the U.S., the Fed collects data from multiple sources, including a countrys statistical agencies and the World Bank. The only drawback to using a Fed database is a lack of updating in GDP data and an absence of data for certain countries. The BEA is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce. It issues its analysis document with each GDP release, which is a great investor tool for analyzing figures and trends and reading highlights of the very lengthy full release. What Is a Simple Definition of GDP? Gross domestic product is a measurement that seeks to capture a countrys economic output. Countries with larger GDPs will have a greater amount of goods and services generated within them, and will generally have a higher standard of living. For this reason, many citizens and political leaders see GDP growth as an important measure of national success, often referring to GDP growth and economic growth interchangeably. Due to various limitations, however, many economists have argued that GDP should not be used as a proxy for overall economic success, much less the success of a society. Which Country Has the Highest GDP? The countries with the two highest GDPs in the world are the United States and China. However, their ranking differs depending on how you measure GDP. Using nominal GDP, the United States comes in first with a GDP of 27.72 trillion as of 2023, compared to 17.79 trillion in China. Many economists argue that it is more accurate to use purchasing power parity GDP as a measure of national wealth. By this metric, China is the world leader with a 2023 PPP GDP of 34.66 trillion, followed by 27.72 trillion in the United States. Is a High GDP Good? Most people perceive a higher GDP to be a good thing because it is associated with greater economic opportunities and an improved standard of material well-being. It is possible, however, for a country to have a high GDP and still be an unattractive place to live, so it is important to also consider other measurements. For example, a country could have a high GDP and a low per-capita GDP, suggesting that significant wealth exists but is concentrated in the hands of very few people. One way to address this is to look at GDP alongside another measure of economic development, such as the Human Development Index HDI . The Bottom Line In their seminal textbook Economics, Paul Samuelson and William Nordhaus neatly sum up the importance of the national accounts and GDP. They liken the ability of GDP to give an overall picture of the state of the economy to that of a satellite in space that can survey the weather across an entire continent. GDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting or expanding, whether it needs a boost or restraint, and if a threat such as a recession or inflation looms on the horizon. Like any measure, GDP has its imperfections. In recent decades, governments have created various nuanced modifications in attempts to increase GDP accuracy and specificity. Means of calculating GDP have also evolved continually since its conception to keep up with evolving measurements of industry activity and the generation and consumption of new, emerging forms of intangible assets.",

    "text": "What Is Inflation? Inflation is a gradual loss of purchasing power that is reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time. The inflation rate is calculated as the average price increase of a basket of selected goods and services over one year. High inflation means that prices are increasing quickly, while low inflation means that prices are growing more slowly. Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when prices decline and purchasing power increases. Key Takeaways Inflation measures how quickly the prices of goods and services are rising. Inflation is classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. The most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index. Inflation can be viewed positively or negatively depending on the individual viewpoint and rate of change. Those with tangible assets may like to see some inflation as it raises the value of their assets. What Is Inflation? Understanding Inflation An increase in the money supply is the root of inflation, though this can play out through different mechanisms in the economy. A countrys money supply can be increased by the monetary authorities by Printing and giving away more money to citizens Legally devaluing reducing the value of the legal tender currency Loaning new money into existence as reserve account credits through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks on the secondary market Other causes of inflation include supply bottlenecks and shortages of key goods, which can push prices to rise. When inflation occurs, money loses its purchasing power. This can occur across any sector or throughout an entire economy. The expectation of inflation itself can further sustain the devaluation of money. Workers may demand higher wages and businesses may charge higher prices, in anticipation of sustained inflation. This, in turn, reinforces the factors that push prices up. Melissa Ling Investopedia, 2019 Types of Inflation Inflation can be classified into three types demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-Pull Effect Demand-pull inflation occurs when an increase in the supply of money and credit stimulates the overall demand for goods and services to increase more rapidly than the economys production capacity. This increases demand and leads to price rises. When people have more money, it leads to positive consumer sentiment. This, in turn, leads to higher spending, which pulls prices higher. It creates a demand-supply gap with higher demand and less flexible supply, which results in higher prices. Cost-Push Effect Cost-push inflation is a result of the increase in prices working through the production process inputs. When additions to the supply of money and credit are channeled into a commodity or other asset markets, costs for all kinds of intermediate goods rise. This is especially evident when theres a negative economic shock to the supply of key commodities. These developments lead to higher costs for the finished product or service and work their way into rising consumer prices. For instance, when the money supply is expanded, it creates a speculative boom in oil prices . This means that the cost of energy can rise and contribute to rising consumer prices, which is reflected in various measures of inflation. Built-In Inflation Built-in inflation is related to adaptive expectations or the idea that people expect current inflation rates to continue in the future. As the price of goods and services rises, people may expect a continuous rise in the future at a similar rate. As such, workers may demand more costs or wages to maintain their standard of living. Their increased wages result in a higher cost of goods and services, and this wage-price spiral continues as one factor induces the other and vice versa. How Inflation Impacts Prices While it is easy to measure the price changes of individual products over time, human needs extend beyond just one or two products. Individuals need a big and diversified set of products as well as a host of services to live a comfortable life. They include commodities like food grains, metal, fuel, utilities like electricity and transportation, and services like healthcare , entertainment, and labor. Inflation aims to measure the overall impact of price changes for a diversified set of products and services. It allows for a single value representation of the increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a specified time. Prices rise, which means that one unit of money buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the cost of living for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nations money supply growth outpaces economic growth. 3 The increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPI-U over the 12 months ending January 2025 on an unadjusted basis. Prices increased by 0.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis in January 2025 from the previous month. To combat this, the monetary authority in most cases, the central bank takes the necessary steps to manage the money supply and credit to keep inflation within permissible limits and keep the economy running smoothly. Theoretically, monetarism is a popular theory that explains the relationship between inflation and the money supply of an economy. For example, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, massive amounts of gold and silver flowed into the Spanish and other European economies. Since the money supply rapidly increased, the value of money fell, contributing to rapidly rising prices. Inflation is measured in a variety of ways depending on the types of goods and services. It is the opposite of deflation , which indicates a general decline in prices when the inflation rate falls below 0. Keep in mind that deflation shouldnt be confused with disinflation , which is a related term referring to a slowing down in the positive rate of inflation. Julie Bang Investopedia How to Protect Your Finances During Inflation There are a range of measures that individuals can take to protect their finances against inflation. For instance, one may choose to invest in asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary times. This might include commodities like grain, beef, oil, electricity, and natural gas. Commodity prices typically stay one step ahead of product prices, and price increases for commodities are often seen as an indicator of inflation to come. Commodities, which can also be volatile, are easily affected by natural disasters, geopolitics, or conflict. Real estate income may also help buffer against inflation, as landlords can increase their rent to keep pace with the rise of prices overall. The U.S. government also offers Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a type of security indexed to inflation to protect against declines in purchasing power. Types of Price Indexes Depending upon the selected set of goods and services used, multiple types of baskets of goods are calculated and tracked as price indexes. The most commonly used price indexes are the Consumer Price Index CPI and the Wholesale Price Index WPI . Consumer Price Index CPI The CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of goods and services that are of primary consumer needs. They include transportation, food, and medical care. CPI is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them based on their relative weight in the whole basket. The prices in consideration are the retail prices of each item, as available for purchase by the individual citizens. CPI can impact the value of one currency against those of other nations. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living , making it one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS reports the CPI each month and has calculated it as far back as 1913. Important The CPI-U, which was introduced in 1978, represents the buying habits of approximately 88 of the noninstitutional population of the United States. Wholesale Price Index WPI The WPI is another popular measure of inflation. It measures and tracks the changes in the price of goods in the stages before the retail level. While WPI items vary from one country to another, they mostly include items at the producer or wholesale level. For example, it includes cotton prices for raw cotton, cotton yarn, cotton gray goods, and cotton clothing. Although many countries and organizations use the WPI, many other countries, including the U.S., use a similar variant called the Producer Price Index PPI . Producer Price Index PPI The PPI is a family of indexes that measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers of intermediate goods and services over time. The PPI measures price changes from the perspective of the seller and differs from the CPI, which measures price changes from the perspective of the buyer. In all variants, the rise in the price of one component say oil may cancel out the price decline in another say wheat to a certain extent. Overall, each index represents the average weighted price change for the given constituents which may apply at the overall economy , sector, or commodity level. The Formula for Measuring Inflation The above-mentioned variants of price indexes can be used to calculate the value of inflation between two particular months or years. While a lot of ready-made inflation calculators are already available on various financial portals and websites, it is always better to be aware of the underlying methodology to ensure accuracy with a clear understanding of the calculations. Mathematically, Percent Inflation Rate Final CPI Index Value Initial CPI Value 100 Say you wish to know how the purchasing power of 10,000 changed between January 1975 and January 2024. One can find price index data on various portals in a tabular form. From that table, pick up the corresponding CPI figures for the given two months. For September 1975, it was 52.1 initial CPI value, and for January 2024, it was 308.417 final CPI value. Plugging in the formula yields Percent Inflation Rate 308.417 52.1 100 5.9197 100 591.97 Since you wish to know how much 10,000 from January 1975 would be worth in January 2024, multiply the inflation rate by the amount to get the changed dollar value Change in Dollar Value 5.9197 10,000 59,197 This means that 10,000 in January 1975 will be worth 59,197 today. Essentially, if you purchased a basket of goods and services as included in the CPI definition worth 10,000 in 1975, the same basket would cost you 59,197 in January 2024. Advantages and Disadvantages of Inflation Inflation can be construed as either a good or a bad thing, depending upon which side one takes, and how rapidly the change occurs. Advantages Individuals with tangible assets like property or stocked commodities priced in their home currency may like to see some inflation as that raises the price of their assets, which they can sell at a higher rate. Inflation often leads to speculation by businesses in risky projects and by individuals who invest in company stocks because they expect better returns than inflation. An optimum level of inflation is often promoted to encourage spending to a certain extent instead of saving. If the purchasing power of money falls over time, there may be a greater incentive to spend now instead of saving and spending later. It may increase spending, which may boost economic activities in a country. A balanced approach is thought to keep the inflation value in an optimum and desirable range. Disadvantages Buyers of such assets may not be happy with inflation, as they will be required to shell out more money. People who hold assets valued in their home currency, such as cash or bonds, may not like inflation, as it erodes the real value of their holdings. As such, investors looking to protect their portfolios from inflation should consider inflation-hedged asset classes, such as gold, commodities, and real estate investment trusts REITs. Inflation-indexed bonds are another popular option for investors to profit from inflation . High and variable rates of inflation can impose major costs on an economy. Businesses, workers, and consumers must all account for the effects of generally rising prices in their buying, selling, and planning decisions. This introduces an additional source of uncertainty into the economy, because they may guess wrong about the rate of future inflation. Time and resources expended on researching, estimating, and adjusting economic behavior are expected to rise to the general level of prices. Thats opposed to real economic fundamentals, which inevitably represent a cost to the economy as a whole. Even a low, stable, and easily predictable rate of inflation, which some consider otherwise optimal, may lead to serious problems in the economy. Thats because of how, where, and when the new money enters the economy. Whenever new money and credit enter the economy, it is always in the hands of specific individuals or business firms. The process of price level adjustments to the new money supply proceeds as they then spend the new money and it circulates from hand to hand and account to account through the economy. Inflation does drive up some prices first and drives up other prices later. This sequential change in purchasing power and prices known as the Cantillon effect means that the process of inflation not only increases the general price level over time but also distorts relative prices , wages, and rates of return along the way. Economists, in general, understand that distortions of relative prices away from their economic equilibrium are not good for the economy, and Austrian economists even believe this process to be a major driver of cycles of recession in the economy. Pros Leads to higher resale value of assets Optimum levels of inflation encourage spending Cons Buyers have to pay more for products and services Imposes higher prices on the economy Drives some prices up first and others later How Inflation Can Be Controlled A countrys financial regulator shoulders the important responsibility of keeping inflation in check. It is done by implementing measures through monetary policy , which refers to the actions of a central bank or other committees that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply. In the U.S., the Feds monetary policy goals include moderate long-term interest rates, price stability, and maximum employment. Each of these goals is intended to promote a stable financial environment. The Federal Reserve clearly communicates long-term inflation goals in order to keep a steady long-term rate of inflation , which is thought to be beneficial to the economy. Price stability or a relatively constant level of inflation allows businesses to plan for the future since they know what to expect. The Fed believes that this will promote maximum employment, which is determined by non-monetary factors that fluctuate over time and are therefore subject to change. For this reason, the Fed doesnt set a specific goal for maximum employment, and it is largely determined by employers assessments. Maximum employment does not mean zero unemployment, as at any given time there is a certain level of volatility as people vacate and start new jobs. Hyperinflation is often described as a period of inflation of 50 or more per month. Monetary authorities also take exceptional measures in extreme conditions of the economy. For instance, following the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Fed kept the interest rates near zero and pursued a bond-buying program called quantitative easing QE . Some critics of the program alleged it would cause a spike in inflation in the U.S. dollar, but inflation peaked in 2007 and declined steadily over the next eight years. There are many complex reasons why QE didnt lead to inflation or hyperinflation , though the simplest explanation is that the recession itself was a very prominent deflationary environment, and quantitative easing supported its effects. Consequently, U.S. policymakers have attempted to keep inflation steady at around 2 per year. The European Central Bank ECB has also pursued aggressive quantitative easing to counter deflation in the eurozone, and some places have experienced negative interest rates . Thats due to fears that deflation could take hold in the eurozone and lead to economic stagnation. Moreover, countries that experience higher rates of growth can absorb higher rates of inflation. Indias target is around 4 with an upper tolerance of 6 and a lower tolerance of 2, while Brazil aims for 3.25 with an upper tolerance of 4.75 and a lower tolerance of 1.75. Meaning of Inflation, Deflation, and Disinflation While a high inflation rate means that prices are increasing, a low inflation rate does not mean that prices are falling. Counterintuitively, when the inflation rate falls, prices are still increasing, but at a slower rate than before. When the inflation rate falls but remains positive, this is known as disinflation . Conversely, if the inflation rate becomes negative, that means that prices are falling. This is known as deflation , which can have negative effects on an economy. Because buying power increases over time, consumers have less incentive to spend money in the short term, resulting in falling economic activity. Hedging Against Inflation Stocks are considered to be the best hedge against inflation , as the rise in stock prices is inclusive of the effects of inflation. Since additions to the money supply in virtually all modern economies occur as bank credit injections through the financial system, much of the immediate effect on prices happens in financial assets that are priced in their home currency, such as stocks. Special financial instruments exist that one can use to safeguard investments against inflation. They include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities TIPS , a low-risk treasury security that is indexed to inflation where the principal amount invested is increased by the percentage of inflation. One can also opt for a TIPS mutual fund or TIPS-based exchange-traded fund ETF . To get access to stocks, ETFs, and other funds that can help avoid the dangers of inflation, youll likely need a brokerage account. Choosing a stockbroker can be a tedious process due to the variety among them. Gold is also considered to be a hedge against inflation, although this doesnt always appear to be the case looking backward. Examples of Inflation Since all world currencies are fiat money , the money supply could increase rapidly for political reasons, resulting in rapid price level increases. The most famous example is the hyperinflation that struck the German Weimar Republic in the early 1920s. The nations that were victorious in World War I demanded reparations from Germany, which could not be paid in German paper currency, as this was of suspect value due to government borrowing. Germany attempted to print paper notes, buy foreign currency with them, and use that to pay their debts. This policy led to the rapid devaluation of the German mark along with the hyperinflation that accompanied the development. German consumers responded to the cycle by trying to spend their money as fast as possible, understanding that it would be worth less and less the longer they waited. More money flooded the economy, and its value plummeted to the point where people would paper their walls with practically worthless bills. Similar situations occurred in Peru in 1990 and in Zimbabwe between 2007 and 2008. What Causes Inflation? There are three main causes of inflation demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Demand-pull inflation refers to situations where there are not enough products or services being produced to keep up with demand, causing their prices to increase. Cost-push inflation, on the other hand, occurs when the cost of producing products and services rises, forcing businesses to raise their prices. Built-in inflation which is sometimes referred to as a wage-price spiral occurs when workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs. This, in turn, causes businesses to raise their prices in order to offset their rising wage costs, leading to a self-reinforcing loop of wage and price increases. Is Inflation Good or Bad? Too much inflation is generally considered bad for an economy, while too little inflation is also considered harmful. Many economists advocate for a middle ground of low to moderate inflation, of around 2 per year. Generally speaking, higher inflation harms savers because it erodes the purchasing power of the money they have saved however, it can benefit borrowers because the inflation-adjusted value of their outstanding debts shrinks over time. What Are the Effects of Inflation? Inflation can affect the economy in several ways. For example, if inflation causes a nations currency to decline, this can benefit exporters by making their goods more affordable when priced in the currency of foreign nations. On the other hand, this could harm importers by making foreign-made goods more expensive. Higher inflation can also encourage spending, as consumers will aim to purchase goods quickly before their prices rise further. Savers, on the other hand, could see the real value of their savings erode, limiting their ability to spend or invest in the future. Why Was Inflation So High in 2024? Inflation has remained elevated since 2022 when inflation rates around the world rose to their highest levels since the early 1980s. While there is no single reason for this rapid rise in global prices, a series of events worked together to boost inflation to such high levels. The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and other restrictions that greatly disrupted global supply chains, from factory closures to bottlenecks at maritime ports. Governments also issued stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits to counter the financial impact on individuals and small businesses. When vaccines became widespread and the economy bounced back, demand fueled in part by stimulus money and low interest rates quickly outpaced supply, which struggled to get back to pre-COVID levels. Russias unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Russia, limiting the worlds supply of oil and gas since Russia is a large producer of fossil fuels. Food prices also rose as Ukraines large grain harvests could not be exported. As fuel and food prices rose, it led to similar increases down the value chains. The Fed raised interest rates to combat the high inflation, which significantly came down in 2023, though it remains above pre-pandemic levels . The Bottom Line Inflation is a rise in prices, which results in the decline of purchasing power over time. Inflation is natural and the U.S. government targets an annual inflation rate of 2 however, inflation can be dangerous when it increases too much, too fast. Inflation makes items more expensive, especially if wages do not rise by the same levels of inflation. Additionally, inflation erodes the value of some assets, especially cash. Governments and central banks seek to control inflation through monetary policy.",

    "text": "Definition The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labor force that is not currently employed. What Is the Unemployment Rate? The U.S. unemployment rate is released on the first Friday of every month for the preceding month. The current and past editions of the report are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS . The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force without a job. It is a lagging indicator and generally rises or falls with changing economic conditions. Key Takeaways The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labor force that is not employed but could be. The BLS reported an unemployment rate for December 2024 of 4.1. U.S. unemployment data is released on the first Friday of every month. There are five other categories of unemployment, which measure labor underutilization. Investopedia Dennis Madamba Understanding the Unemployment Rate In the U.S., the most commonly cited national unemployment rate is the U-3, which the BLS releases as part of its monthly employment situation report. It defines unemployed people as those willing and available to work and who have actively sought work within the past four weeks. 4.1 The national unemployment rate for December 2024. The rate decreased by 0.1 from the previous month. According to the BLS, those with temporary, part-time, or full-time jobs are considered employed, as are those who perform at least 15 hours of unpaid work for a family business or farm. Many people who want to work but cannot or become discouraged after looking for work without success are not considered unemployed, but categorized outside the labor force. The unemployment rate is seasonally adjusted to account for predictable variations, such as extra hiring during the holidays. The BLS also provides the unadjusted rate. Unemployment Rate seasonally adjusted Unadjusted Unemployment by State Other Metrics The BLS publishes five alternative measures U-1, U-2, U-4, U-5, and U-6 . U-6 is often called the real unemployment rate, but U-3 is the only official unemployment rate. The others are measures of labor underutilization. U-1 The U-1 unemployment rate includes those unemployed for 15 weeks or more as a percent of the civilian labor force . The U-1 unemployment rate as of December 2024 was 1.6.

The U-5 rate for December 2024 was 5.0. The marginally attached include discouraged workers and anyone who would like a job and has looked for one in the past 12 months but actively gave up searching. As with U-5, the denominator is expanded to include the marginally attached, who are not technically part of the labor force.

Every month the Census Bureau, part of the Department of Commerce DOC, conducts the Current Population Survey CPS using a sample of approximately 60,000 households, or about 110,000 individuals. The survey includes information on race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, and gender. The sample is rotated so that 75 of the households remain constant from month to month and 50 from year to year. The surveys include industry information, occupations, average earnings, and union membership. For those who are jobless, interviewers also ask whether they quit or were fired or laid off. The survey excludes individuals under the age of 16 and those who are in the Armed Forces. People in correctional facilities, mental healthcare facilities, and similar institutions are also excluded. Interviewers ask questions that determine employment status but do not ask whether respondents are employed or unemployed. Nor do the interviewers assign employment status they record the answers for the BLS to analyze. Unemployment and the Economy Unemployment is one of the most closely-watched indicators for economic health, along with gross domestic product GDP and the consumer price index CPI . The unemployment rate has an inverse relationship with the stock market and inflation, two key metrics for the overall economy. A low unemployment rate tends to be associated with an increased average wage, due to the reduced labor supply. This can result in inflation , as employers raise prices to account for increased labor costs. Low unemployment also tends to be accompanied by increased stock prices, because the workforce has more disposable income. What Is the U.S. Unemployment Rate? The unemployment rate in the United States was 4.1 for December 2024. What Is a Healthy Unemployment Rate? Low unemployment is not considered healthy, as lower rates can be seen as inflationary due to pricing pressure on salaries however, high unemployment is not considered healthy, as higher rates can be seen as a financial strain on consumer spending. In general, most experts deem unemployment between 3 and 5 to be ideal, though there is no single consensus on what constitutes healthy unemployment. Whats the Difference Between U-3 and U-6 Unemployment Rates? U-3 is the headline unemployment number seen in the news. It looks at out-of-work Americans looking for employment within the past four weeks. The more comprehensive U-6 includes everyone in U-3 plus those with only temporary work and people considered marginally attached to the labor force. How Is U.S. Unemployment Data Collected? The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys approximately 60,000 households in person or over the phone. The responses are later aggregated by race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, and gender, all of whichalong with geographyadd greater detail to the employment picture. The Bottom Line In assessing an economys health, the nations unemployment rate plays a major factor in setting monetary policy and making strategic economic decisions. There are various ways to calculate unemployment , however, the general public is most familiar with the U-3 rate. The calculation for this iteration of the unemployment rate is to divide the number of unemployed individuals by the total workforce.",

    "text": "Definition An interest rate is the price an entity pays for borrowing money or the fee they charge for lending it, expressed as a percentage. What Is an Interest Rate? The interest rate is the percentage of interest relative to the principal . It is either what lenders charge borrowers or what is earned from deposit accounts. The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis and is expressed as an annual percentage rate APR. An interest rate can also apply to a savings account or a certificate of deposit CD. In this case, a bank or credit union pays a percentage of the funds deposited to the account holder. Annual percentage yield APY refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts. Key Takeaways An interest rate also applies to the amount earned at a bank or credit union from a deposit account. Most mortgages use simple interest. However, some loans use compound interest, which is applied to the principal but also to the accumulated interest of previous periods. A loan that is considered low-risk by the lender will have a lower interest rate. A loan that is considered high-risk will have a higher interest rate. The APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. Savings accounts and CDs use compound interest. Investopedia Julie Bang Understanding Interest Rates In lending, interest is a charge to the borrower for the use of an asset. Assets borrowed can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and property. Because of this, an interest rate can be thought of as the cost of money. Higher interest rates make borrowing the same amount of money more expensive. Interest rates apply to most lending or borrowing transactions. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes, fund projects, launch or fund businesses, or pay for college tuition. Businesses take out loans to fund capital projects and expand their operations by purchasing fixed and long-term assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. Borrowed money is repaid either in a lump sum by a pre-determined date or in periodic installments. For loans, the interest rate is applied to the principal, which is the amount of the loan. The interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The money to be repaid is usually more than the borrowed amount since lenders require compensation for the loss of use of the money during the loan period. The lender could have invested the funds during that period instead of providing a loan, which would have generated income from the asset. The difference between the total repayment sum and the original loan is the interest charged. When the loan is considered to be low risk by the lender, the borrower will usually be charged a lower interest rate. If the loan is considered high risk, the interest rate that the borrower is charged will be higher. Important Risk is typically assessed when a lender looks at a potential borrowers credit score, which is why its important to have an excellent one if you want to qualify for the best loans. Simple Interest Rate If you take out a 300,000 loan from the bank and the loan agreement stipulates that the interest rate on the loan is 4 simple interest, this means that you will have to pay the bank the original loan amount of 300,000 4 x 300,000 300,000 12,000 312,000. The example above was calculated based on the annual simple interest formula, which is Simple interest principal x interest rate x time The individual who took out the loan will have to pay 12,000 in interest at the end of the year, assuming it was only a one-year lending agreement. If the loan was a 30-year mortgage, the interest payment will be Simple interest 300,000 x 4 x 30 360,000 A simple interest rate of 4 annually translates into an annual interest payment of 12,000. After 30 years, the borrower would have made 12,000 x 30 years 360,000 in interest payments. Compound Interest Rate Some lenders prefer the compound interest method, which means that the borrower pays even more in interest. Compound interest, also called interest on interest , is applied both to the principal and also to the accumulated interest made during previous periods. The bank assumes that at the end of the first year the borrower owes the principal plus interest for that year. The bank also assumes that at the end of the second year, the borrower owes the principal plus the interest for the first year plus the interest on interest for the first year. The interest owed when compounding is higher than the interest owed using the simple interest method. The interest is charged monthly on the principal, including accrued interest from the previous months. For shorter time frames, the calculation of interest will be similar for both methods. As the lending time increases, however, the disparity between the two types of interest calculations grows. Using the example above, at the end of 30 years, the total owed in interest is almost 673,019 on a 300,000 loan with a 4 interest rate. The following formula can be used to calculate compound interest Compound interest p x 1 interest rate n 1 where p principal n number of compounding periods Lets look at another example. Jayati takes out a three-year loan of 10,000 at an interest rate of 5, which compounds annually. In the end, as worked out in the calculation below, she pays 1,576.25 in interest on the loan 10,000 1 0.05 3 1 10,000 1.157625 1 1,576.25 Compound Interest and Savings Accounts When you save money using a savings account, compound interest is favorable. The interest earned on these accounts is compounded and serves as compensation to the account holder for allowing the bank to use the deposited funds. If, for example, you deposit 500,000 into a high-yield savings account , the bank can take 300,000 of these funds to use as a mortgage loan. To compensate you, the bank pays 5 interest into the account annually. So, while the bank is taking 8 from the borrower, it is giving 5 to you, the account holder, netting it 3 in interest. In effect, savers lend the bank money which, in turn, provides funds to borrowers in return for interest. APR vs. APY Interest rates on consumer loans are typically quoted as the annual percentage rate APR . This is the rate of return that lenders demand for the ability to borrow their money. For example, the interest rate on credit cards is quoted as an APR. In our example above, 4 is the APR for the mortgage . The APR does not consider compounded interest for the year. The annual percentage yield APY is the interest rate that is earned at a bank or credit union from a savings account or CD. This interest rate takes compounding into account. How Are Interest Rates Determined? The interest rate charged by banks is determined by a number of factors, including the state of the economy. A countrys central bank e.g., the Federal Reserve in the U.S. sets the interest rate, which each bank uses to determine the APR range they offer. When the central bank sets interest rates at a high level, the cost of debt rises. When the cost of debt is high, it discourages people from borrowing and slows consumer demand. Interest rates tend to rise with inflation . In a high-interest-rate economy, businesses have limited access to capital funding through debt, which can lead to economic contraction. Economies are often stimulated during periods of low interest rates because borrowers have access to loans at inexpensive rates. Since interest rates on savings are low, businesses and individuals are more likely to spend and purchase riskier investment vehicles such as stocks. This spending fuels the economy and provides an injection to capital markets leading to economic expansion. While governments prefer lower interest rates, they eventually lead to market disequilibrium where demand exceeds supply, causing inflation. When inflation occurs, interest rates increase, which may relate to Walras law . 6.85 The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in February 2025. This was slightly down from 6.90 a year earlier. Interest Rates and Race There is evidence that suggests that white people get approved more often for mortgages. Data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the most comprehensive publicly-available information on mortgage market activity, showed that Black, Hispanic, and Asian applicants were denied conventional mortgage loans in 2023 17.1, 12.1, and 9.7 of the time, respectively. The denial rate for white applicants, on the other hand, was lower at 6.8. Evidence of interest rate discrimination with mortgages has been confirmed by other sources, including Harvard University and the Urban Institute, which found in 2022 that the average Black homeowner gets charged an interest rate that is 33 basis points higher than the average white homeowner, and pays about 250 more per year in interest. Not everybody agrees with these findings. A study by economists at the Federal Reserve Board concluded that no racial group gets preferential treatment, leading its authors to speculate that reporting of disparities elsewhere may be due to many Black and Hispanic borrowers tending to choose slightly higher interest rates in return for lower up-front costs. The Federal Reserve Board believes discrimination is improving and credits this, in part, to a rise in automated underwriting and stricter enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Why Are Interest Rates on 30-year Loans Higher than on 15-year Loans? Interest rates are a function of the risk of default and the opportunity cost . Longer loans and debts are inherently more risky, as there is more time for the borrower to default. The same time, the opportunity cost is also larger over longer time periods, as the principal is tied up and cannot be used for any other purpose. How Does the Fed Use Interest Rates? The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, uses interest rates as a monetary policy tool. By increasing the cost of borrowing among commercial banks, the central bank can influence many other interest rates, such as those for personal loans, business loans, and mortgages. This makes borrowing more expensive in general, lowering the demand for money and cooling off a hot economy. Lowering interest rates, on the other hand, makes money easier to borrow, stimulating spending and investment. Why Do Bond Prices React Inversely to Interest Rate Changes? A bond is a debt instrument that typically pays a fixed rate of interest over its lifetime. Say that prevailing interest rates are 5. If a bond is priced at par 1,000 and has an interest rate coupon of 5, it will pay bondholders 50 a year. If interest rates rise to 10, new bonds issued will pay doublei.e., 100 per 1,000 in face value . An existing bond that only pays 50 will have to sell at a steep discount in order for somebody to want to buy it. Likewise, if interest rates drop to 1, new bonds will only pay 10 per 1,000 in face value. Hence, a bond that pays 50 will be in high demand and its price will be bid up quite high. The Bottom Line An interest rate is the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. When you take out a loan, you are expected to pay the entity lending you money something extra as compensation. Likewise, if you deposit money in a savings account, the financial institution may reward you because it can use part of this money to make more loans to its customers. These charges or payments are called interest and are applied at a specified rate.",

    "text": "Definition The Consumer Price Index CPI measures monthly changes in prices paid by U.S. consumers. What Is the Consumer Price Index CPI? The Consumer Price Index CPI measures the monthly change in prices paid by U.S. consumers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS calculates the CPI as a weighted average of prices for a basket of goods and services representative of aggregate U.S. consumer spending. The CPI is a measure of inflation and deflation. The CPI report uses a different survey methodology, price samples, and index weights than the producer price index PPI , which measures changes in the prices paid by U.S. producers of goods and services. Key Takeaways The Consumer Price Index measures the overall change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of goods and services over time. The CPI is a widely used measure of inflation, closely followed by policymakers, financial markets, businesses, and consumers. The CPI is based on about 80,000 price quotes collected monthly from retail stores, service establishments, rental units, and doctors offices. Investopedia Katie Kerpel Data Collection The BLS collects about 80,000 prices monthly from retail stores, service establishments, rental units, and doctors offices. The data compiled and used to track prices covers 93 of the U.S. population. User fees and sales or excise taxes are included, while income taxes and the prices of investments such as stocks, bonds, or life insurance policies are not part of the CPI. CPI indexes account for substitution effects consumers tendency to shift spending away from products and categories has grown relatively more expensive. It also adjusts price data for changes in product quality and features. The weighting of the product and service categories in the CPI indexes corresponds to recent consumer spending patterns derived from a separate survey. Shelter category prices are based on a survey of rental prices for 50,000 housing units, which is then used to calculate the rise in rental prices as well as owners equivalents. The owners equivalent category models the rent equivalent for owner-occupied housing to properly reflect housing costs share of consumer spending . Types of Consumer Price Indexes CPIs The BLS publishes two indexes each month. The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPI-U represents 93 of the U.S. population not living in remote rural areas. It doesnt cover spending by people living in farm households, institutions, or on military bases. CPI-U is the basis of the widely reported CPI numbers that matter to financial markets. The BLS also publishes the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers CPI-W . The CPI-W covers 29 of the U.S. population living in households with income derived predominantly from clerical employment or jobs with an hourly wage. CPI-W is used to adjust Social Security payments as well as other federal benefits and pensions for changes in the cost of living. It also shifts federal income tax brackets to ensure taxpayers arent subjected to a higher marginal rate as a result of inflation. Fast Fact The CPI-U increased 3 over the 12 months ending January 2025 before seasonal adjustment. The index increased by 0.5 in January 2025 on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to a 0.4 increase in December 2024. CPI-U Formula The more common CPI-U calculation entails two primary formulas. The first is used to determine the current cost of the weighted average basket of products, while the second is used to analyze the year-over-year YOY change. To calculate the annual CPI, the BLS divides the current value of a specific basket of goods compared to one year ago Annual CPI Value of Basket in Current Year Value of Basket in Prior Year 100 beginalignedtextAnnual CPIfractextValue of Basket in Current YeartextValue of Basket in Prior Yeartimes 100endaligned Annual CPI Value of Basket in Prior Year Value of Basket in Current Year 100 The basket of goods and services used in the CPI calculation is a composite of popular items commonly purchased by Americans. The weight of each component of the basket is in proportion to how they are sold. The annual CPI is reported as a whole number, and the figure is often greater than 100, assuming current market prices are appreciating. Then, the BLS uses the current years CPI and the prior years CPI to calculate the inflation rate.

Investopedia Maddy Price CPI Categories The monthly CPI release from the BLS leads with the change from the prior month for the overall CPI-U as well as its key subcategories, along with the unadjusted change year-over-year. The BLSs detailed tables show price changes for a variety of goods and services organized by eight umbrella spending categories. Subcategories estimate price changes for everything from tomatoes and salad dressing to auto repairs and sporting events tickets. Price changes for each subcategory are provided with and without seasonal adjustment . BLS also publishes CPI data for U.S. regions, sub-regions, and major metropolitan areas. The metro data is subject to wider fluctuations and is useful mainly to identify price changes based on local conditions. The table below represents the CPI basket weighted distribution for food, energy, and all other items. CPI Categories by Weight Group Weight Food 13.69 Energy 6.22 All Items Less Food Energy 80.9 Total 100 Source Bureau of Labor Statistics Using the CPI The CPI is widely used by financial market participants to gauge inflation and by the Federal Reserve to calibrate its monetary policy. Businesses and consumers also use the CPI to make informed economic decisions. Since CPI measures the change in consumers purchasing power , it is often a key factor in pay negotiations. The Federal Reserve The Fed uses CPI data to determine economic policy. With a target inflation rate of 2, the Fed may enact expansionary monetary policy to stimulate the economy should market growth slow, or enact contractionary monetary policy should the economy grow too quickly. In response to higher-than-desired inflation rates via the CPI, the Fed adjusts the Fed funds rate . COLAs The cost-of-living adjustments COLAs based on the CPI affect federal payments to the approximately 70 million Americans receiving Social Security and Supplemental Security Income SSI benefits. They also apply to federal pension payments, school lunch subsidies, and income tax brackets. Housing Mortgage rates and long-term debt are often impacted by rates set by government agencies. As the CPI increases and the government enacts policy changes to slow inflation, rates often increase. Landlords may use CPI information to adequately assess what annual rent increases for renters should be. Financial markets Financial market prices can react to the CPI, as reactionary Fed policies directly impact economic growth, corporate profits, and consumer spending ability. A higher CPI often means that a less stringent government policy is generally in place. Debt is easier to obtain and individuals have greater spending capacity. Lower or decreasing CPI may indicate that the government may ease policies that help boost the economy. Labor The CPI and its components support changes in hourly or weekly earnings. Employees may turn to CPI reports when approaching their employers for a raise based on nationwide increases in labor rates as well as pricing. Some workers covered by collective bargaining agreements may have their contracts and wages tied to changes in CPI . Note The BLS reports the CPI on a fixed, monthly basis. A schedule of prior and future releases can be found on the BLS website, and the CPI is always released at 830 a.m. Eastern time. How Does the CPI Affect Unemployment Rates? In the broadest sense, the CPI and unemployment rates are often inversely related. The Federal Reserve often attempts to decrease one metric while balancing the other. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve took unprecedented supervisory and regulatory actions to stimulate the economy. As a result, the labor market strengthened and returned to pre-pandemic rates by March 2022 however, the stimulus resulted in the highest CPI calculations in decades. When the Federal Reserve attempts to lower the CPI, it runs the risk of unintentionally increasing unemployment rates. How Is the Consumer Price Index Used? The CPI Index is an inflation indicator closely watched by policymakers and financial markets. A related CPI measure is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for federal benefit payments. What Are Some Criticisms of the CPI? The CPI-U calculation only measures inflation for urban populations and remains a less-than-reliable source of data for individuals living in rural areas. The CPI does not explicitly state how different demographics may be impacted by inflation. For example, soaring education costs may adversely impact younger individuals, while the impact of increasing elderly care costs is felt by a different group of individuals. Lower-income individuals who contribute more gross income towards necessities of shelter and food will skew differently than households with larger disposable income. For this reason, the CPI may not adequately reflect each individuals experience about costs and changes over time. The Bottom Line The Consumer Price Index measures the average change in prices paid by consumers over time for a basket of goods and services. The index is calculated and published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is a common measure of inflation, indicating the health and direction of the economy. It also serves in other capacities, notably to help make adjustments to certain income payments, such as Social Security and pensions for federal civil service retirees.",

    "text": "What Is Technical Analysis? Technical analysis is a method of evaluating statistical trends in trading activity, typically involving price movement and volume. It is used to identify trading and investment opportunities. Unlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a securitys value based on financial information such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on price and volume to draw conclusions about future price movements. Key Takeaways Technical analysis is used to evaluate price trends and patterns and thereby identify potential investments and trading opportunities. Technical analysts believe past trading activity and a securitys price changes can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements. Technical analysis may be contrasted with fundamental analysis, which focuses on a companys financials rather than historical price patterns or stock trends. Technical analysis was introduced by Charles Dow. Investopedia Candra Huff Understanding Technical Analysis Technical analysis is used to scrutinize the ways supply and demand for a security affect changes in price, volume, and implied volatility. It assumes that past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the securitys future price movements when paired with appropriate investing or trading rules. Technical analysis various charting tools are often used to generate short-term trading signals. They can also help improve the evaluation of a securitys strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its sectors. This information helps analysts improve their overall valuation estimate. Technical analysis as we know it today was first introduced by Charles Dow as the Dow Theory in the late 1800s. Several noteworthy researchers including William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson Gould, and John Magee further contributed to Dow Theory concepts. Nowadays, technical analysis has evolved to include hundreds of patterns and signals developed through years of research. How Technical Analysis Is Used Professional analysts often use technical analysis in conjunction with other forms of research. Retail traders may make decisions based solely on the price charts of a security and similar statistics. But practicing equity analysts rarely limit their research to fundamental or technical analysis alone. Technical analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data. This includes stocks, futures , commodities , fixed-income securities, currencies, and more. In fact, technical analysis is prevalent in commodities and forex markets where traders focus on short-term price movements. Technical analysis attempts to forecast the price movement of virtually any tradable instrument that is generally subject to forces of supply and demand. Some view technical analysis as simply the supply and demand forces reflected by the market price movements of a security. Technical analysis most commonly applies to price changes, but some analysts track numbers other than just price, such as trading volume or open interest figures. Technical Analysis Indicators Hundreds of patterns and signals have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading. Technical analysts have also developed numerous types of trading systems to help them forecast and trade on price movements. Some indicators focus primarily on identifying the current market trend, including support and resistance areas. Others focus on determining the strength of a trend and the likelihood of its continuation. Commonly used technical indicators and charting patterns include trendlines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators. In general, technical analysts look at the following broad types of indicators Price trends Chart patterns Volume and momentum indicators Oscillators Moving averages Support and resistance levels Fast Fact The CMT Association supports the largest collection of chartered or certified analysts using technical analysis professionally around the world. The associations Chartered Market Technician CMT designation can be obtained after three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical analysis tools. Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis Technical analysis attempts to decipher the market sentiment behind price trends by looking for price patterns and trends. Charles Dow released a series of editorials discussing technical analysis theory. He had two basic assumptions that continue to form the framework for technical analysis trading. Markets are efficient with values that represent factors that influence a securitys price. Even random market price movements appear to move in identifiable patterns and trends that tend to repeat over time. Today the field of technical analysis builds on Dows work. Professional analysts typically accept three general assumptions The market discounts everything Technical analysts believe that everything from a companys fundamentals to broad market factors to market psychology is already priced into a stock. The Efficient Markets Hypothesis EMH draws a similar conclusion about prices. The only thing remaining is the analysis of price movements, which technical analysts view as the product of supply and demand for a particular stock. Price moves in trends Technical analysts expect that prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. In other words, a stock price is more likely to continue a past trend than to move erratically. Most technical trading strategies are based on this assumption. History tends to repeat itself The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable and based on emotions such as fear and excitement. Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze these emotions and subsequent price movements to understand trends. While many forms of technical analysis have been used for more than 100 years, they are believed to be relevant still because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves. Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis Fundamental analysis and technical analysis, the major schools of thought when it comes to approaching the markets, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Both methods are used to research and forecast future trends in stock prices , and like any investment strategy or philosophy, both have their advocates and adversaries. Fundamental Analysis Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies. Earnings , expenses , assets, and liabilities are all important characteristics of fundamental analysis that help analysts determine the fair value of a business. Technical Analysis Technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis in that the stocks price and volume are the only inputs. The core assumption is that all publicly known fundamentals have factored into price thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a securitys intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that suggest how a stocks price will move in the future. Limitations of Technical Analysis 1. For some analysts and academic researchers, the EMH demonstrates why no actionable information is contained in historical price and volume data. However, by the same reasoning, nor should business fundamentals provide actionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and semi-strong form of the EMH. 2. Another criticism of technical analysis is that history does not repeat itself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be ignored. Prices seem to be better modeled as a random walk. 3. A third criticism of technical analysis is that it works in some cases but only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, many technical traders will place a stop-loss order below the 200-day moving average of a certain company. If a large number of traders have done so and the stock reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock price down, confirming the movement traders anticipated. Then, other traders will see the price decrease and sell their positions, reinforcing the strength of the trend. This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the assets price will be weeks or months from now. In sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal. However, over the long run, this sole group of traders cannot drive the price. What Assumptions Do Technical Analysts Make? Professional technical analysts typically assume three things. First, the market discounts everything. Second, prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. Third, history tends to repeat itself. The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable. Whats the Difference Between Fundamental and Technical Analysis? Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. The core assumption of technical analysis, on the other hand, is that all known fundamentals are factored into price thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a securitys intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that might suggest how the securitys price will move in the future. How Can I Learn Technical Analysis? Your first step is to learn about investing, stocks, markets, and financials. This can be done through books, online courses and materials, and in-person classes. Once you understand the basics, you can start studying technical analysis . The Bottom Line Technical analysis is a longstanding method of analyzing the price and volume data of securities to determine future price action. This data usually appears on charts. Investors and professional traders apply a variety of technical indicators to these price and volume charts to draw conclusions and make decisions about entry and exit points for trades.",

    "text": "Definition Fundamental analysis is a technique to measure a companys value based on its financials and other objective metrics, as opposed to market price trends. What Is Fundamental Analysis? Fundamental analysis involves examining a companys financial statements and broader economic indicators to uncover a securitys intrinsic value. The result of such an analysis should give you the investments true worth based on a companys financial health, the market, and economic conditions. Investors perform fundamental analysis to gauge whether or not to invest in a company based on its current and projected worth. Key Takeaways Fundamental analysis is a method of determining a stocks intrinsic value. Fundamental analysts search for stocks trading at prices higher or lower than their real value. Fundamental analysis is different from technical analysis, which studies historical price trends and market sentiment. Most analysts use a combination of fundamental and technical analysis. Investopedia Paige McLaughlin Understanding Fundamental Analysis Fundamental analysis looks at intrinsic factors to determine a companys value, as opposed to its current price or market trends. This approach looks beyond investor sentiment and company marketing to determine if the stock price is over- or undervalued. Fundamental analysis starts by examining the companys financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. Analysts look at the companys assets, debts, revenue, and other metrics, and compare them with other companies in the same industry. In addition, fundamental analysis also looks at macroeconomic factors to see if the company is positioned for success. Analysts may consider gross domestic product, inflation, interest rates, industry or sector trends, and the companys competition. This approach often includes reviewing the companys business model, management effectiveness, brand awareness, and potential for growth and profitability. Why Is Fundamental Analysis Important? Fundamentals allow investors to look beyond short-term price fluctuations and focus on the underlying factors that drive a companys operations and long-term performance. The main benefit of fundamental analysis is to help quantify the value of a company and its shares. Financial statements offer hard data that reveal insights into a companys profitability, liquidity , and overall financial stability. This information, along with an assessment of the companys management team, competitive advantages, and industry trends, furnishes an objective measure of the companys value. With this knowledge, investors can make more informed decisions about buying, holding, or selling a particular stock. Fundamental analysis can also help investors identify undervalued companies. By considering a companys sales growth, market share, and product pipeline, investors can gauge its ability to increase future profits and grow shareholder value. Value investors , in particular, look for undervalued shares relative to their fundamental potential. It can also help spot red flags and overvalued investments. By researching a companys financial health and market position, investors can determine if a company is likely to underperform or experience significant downturns. This is especially important during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility. Where to Find Fundamentals for a Company Some of the most common and reliable sources for the fundamentals of a company include the following Company filings Public companies are required to file regular reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, such as Form 10-K annual report, Form 10-Q quarterly report, and Form 8-K current events report. These filings contain detailed financial statements, management discussions and analyses, and other important information about the company. You can access these filings for free on the SECs EDGAR database. Company website Most publicly traded companies have an investor relations section that provides financial statements, earnings releases, investor presentations, and other relevant information for shareholders and potential investors. Earnings call transcripts can be particularly helpful since companies use them to address their soft spots for analysts. Financial platforms Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, and MarketWatch, among others, provide financial news, analysis, and fundamental data on publicly traded companies, including financial statements, key ratios, and analyst ratings. Broker research reports Many brokerage firms supply research reports on companies they and their affiliates cover, often with detailed fundamental analysis and investment recommendations. Financial data providers Subscription-based financial data providers such as Bloomberg, FactSet, and Morningstar offer extensive fundamental data and analysis on companies, industries, and markets. Subscriptions are often pricey, so they are more typically used by professional investors and analysts. Industry trade journals Trade publications covering specific industries can provide valuable insights on industry trends, competitive dynamics, and company-specific developments that inform your fundamental analysis. Remember, when conducting fundamental analysis, its essential to use several sources to get a well-rounded view of a companys financial prospects and to be aware of any potential biases or conflicts of interest in the information youre receiving. Fast Fact Fundamental analysis is used most often for stocks, but it can be useful for evaluating any security, from a bond to a derivative. If you consider the fundamentals, from the broader economy to the company details, you are doing a fundamental analysis. How to Read a Companys Annual Report Reading a companys annual report is an essential part of fundamental analysis. Heres a step-by-step guide on how to read and analyze an annual report Start with the CEOs letter to shareholders This section gives an overview of the companys performance, key developments, and outlook from the perspective of top management. Pay attention to the tone and content of the letter, as it can give insights into the companys strategy, challenges, and prospects. Review the business description This section describes the companys main products or services, target markets, competitive advantages, and key risks. It can help you understand the companys business model and the factors that drive its success. Analyze the managements discussion and analysis MDA The MDA provides a detailed discussion of the companys financial performance, including revenue and expense trends, cash flows, and key financial ratios. It also has managements perspective on the factors that affect the companys performance and outlook for the future. Examine the financial statements The annual report has the companys audited financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. Review these carefully while looking for trends in revenue, expenses, profits, assets, liabilities, and cash flows. From there, you can compute the critical financial ratios. Read the notes to the financial statements The notes or footnotes provide additional details and explanations about the companys accounting policies, significant transactions, and other important information that may not be clear from the financial statements alone. Review the auditors report This provides an independent opinion on whether the financial statements fairly present the companys financial position and performance following generally accepted accounting principles. Look for any qualified opinions or disclaimers that may indicate potential issues. Analyze the companys corporate governance The annual report often has information on the companys board of directors, executive compensation, and other corporate governance matters. Consider whether the companys governance practices align with the interests of shareholders and whether there are any red flags, such as conflicts of interest or excessive compensation. Look for additional disclosures The annual report may include additional disclosures about legal proceedings, regulatory issues, or environmental, social, and governance ESG factors that could impact the companys performance and reputation. A Closer Look at Financial Statements The information in financial statements is among the most valuable about a companys financial health and performance. Heres a breakdown of what you can learn from each one Income Statement This shows how much money a company is making revenue, how much theyre spending expenses, and whats left over profit or loss. By looking at trends in revenue and expenses over time, you can get a sense of whether the company is growing or struggling. You can also calculate important ratios like the companys profit margin, which tells you how much of each dollar in sales the company gets to keep as profit. Balance Sheet This gives you a snapshot of what a company owns assets, what it owes liabilities, and what is left over shareholders equity . This can help you assess a companys financial stability and liquidity. For example, if a company has a lot more assets than liabilities, thats generally a good sign. You can also look at how much debt the company has relative to its equity to understand its financial leverage and risk. Statement of Cash Flows This shows how much cash is coming in and going out of the company over a given period. Its broken down into three main categories cash from operations the money generated by the companys core business activities, cash from investing the money spent or earned from investments not related to the core business, and cash from financing the money raised or paid out and used to fund the business. By looking at a companys cash flows, you can better understand its ability to generate cash, pay its bills, and invest in growth. The cash flow statement is crucial because its harder for a business to manipulate its cash situation. An aggressive accountant can do plenty of things to manipulate earnings, for example, but its tough to fake cash in the bank. For this reason, some investors use the cash flow statement as a more conservative measure of a companys performance. Fast Fact A balance sheet gets its name because the three sections it containsassets, liabilities, and shareholders equitymust balance out using this formula Assets Liabilities Shareholders Equity Quantitative and Qualitative Fundamental Analysis The problem with defining the fundamentals is that they can cover anything related to a companys economic well-being. They can include numbers like revenue and profit, but they can also include anything from a companys market share to the quality of its management. Generally, these are grouped into two categories quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative information that can be shown using numbers, figures, ratios, or formulas Qualitative rather than a quantity of something, it is its quality, standard, or nature In this context, quantitative fundamentals are hard numbers, the measurable characteristics of a business. The most significant source of quantitative data is financial statements. The qualitative fundamentals are less tangible. They might include the quality of a companys key executives, brand-name recognition, patents, and proprietary technology . Neither qualitative nor quantitative analysis is inherently better. Many analysts consider them together. Fast Fact Fundamental analysis relies on using financial ratios drawn from data on corporate financial statements to make inferences about a companys value and prospects. Qualitative Fundamentals to Consider There are certain qualitative fundamentals that analysts should always consider when analyzing a company. These include the following The Business Model What exactly does the company do? This isnt always straightforward. If a companys business model is based on selling fast-food chicken, is it making its money that way? Or is it coasting on royalty and franchise fees? Competitive Advantage A companys long-term success is primarily driven by its ability to maintain its competitive advantage. Competitive advantages, such as Coca-Cola Co.s KO brand name and Microsoft Corporations MSFT long domination of the personal computer operating system, create a moat around a business, allowing it to keep competitors at bay and enjoy growth and profits. Management Team Some think management is the most important criterion for investing in a company. This makes sense Even the best business model is doomed if the companys leaders fail to execute the plan properly. While its hard for retail investors to meet and truly evaluate managers, you can look at the corporate website and check the resumes of the top brass and the board members. How well did they do in previous jobs? Have they been unloading a lot of their stock shares lately? Corporate Governance and Board Structure These are provided by the policies within an organization that indicate the relationships and responsibilities among management, directors, and stakeholders . These policies are defined and determined in the company charter, its bylaws, and corporate laws and regulations. You want to do business with a company that is run ethically, fairly, transparently, and efficiently. Note whether management respects shareholder rights and shareholder interests. Ensure their communications to shareholders are transparent and understandable. If you dont get it, if there are major issues you know surround the company and they arent addressed, its not a sign that they have good answers for you. Industry Trends Its also important to consider a companys industry its customer base, market share among firms, industrywide growth, competition, regulation, and business cycles. Learning how the industry works will give an investor a deeper understanding of a companys financial health. Stakeholder Satisfaction Employees, managers, customers, suppliers, investors, and other stakeholders should all have positive views on the company and its prospects. Without that, a companys brand equity and image can suffer, which can lead to fewer sales, lower profits, and flagging share prices. Quantitative Fundamentals to Consider Financial Ratios Financial statements are how a company discloses information about its financial performance. Here are some of the most important financial ratios with their formulas Key Financial Ratios Category Ratio Formula Profitability Gross profit margin Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold Revenue Higher margins and returns generally indicate a more profitable and efficient business. Operating profit margin Operating Income Revenue Net profit Margin Net Income Revenue Return on assets ROA Net Income Average Total Assets Return on equity ROE Net Income Average Shareholders Equity Liquidity Current ratio Current Assets Current Liabilities A higher ratio suggests that the company has enough liquidity to cover its near-term liabilities. Quick ratio Cash Marketable Securities Accounts Receivable Current Liabilities Solvency Debt-to-equity ratio Total Liabilities Total Shareholders Equity These ratios measure a companys ability to meet its long-term debt obligations. Lower debt ratios and higher interest coverage ratios generally indicate a more financially stable company. Debt-to-assets ratio Total Liabilities Total Assets Interest coverage ratio Operating Income Interest Expense Efficiency Asset turnover ratio Revenue Average Total Assets These ratios measure how effectively a company manages its assets to generate sales. Higher turnover ratios suggest that the company is using its assets more efficiently to generate revenue. Inventory turnover ratio Cost of Goods Sold Average Inventory Receivables turnover ratio Revenue Average Accounts Receivable Valuation PE Market Price per Share Earnings per Share Lower ratios may indicate that the stock is undervalued, while higher ratios may suggest that it is overvalued. Price-to-book PB ratio Market Price per Share Book Value per Share Price-to-sales PS ratio Market Price per Share Revenue per Share Dividend yield Annual Dividends per Share Market Price per Share Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis Fundamental analysis contrasts starkly with technical analysis, which attempts to forecast prices by analyzing historical market data such as price and volume. Technical analysis uses price trends and action, often plotted on charts, to create indicators and identify patterns. Some indicators develop patterns that have names resembling their shapes, such as the head and shoulders pattern. A major distinction is where value comes from. For technical analysts, the market sets prices, and hence, the changes there give a company its value. For fundamental analysts, there is an intrinsic value that the market can often miss. Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis Fundamental Analysis Estimates the intrinsic value of a company from its operations Considers a companys financial statements and qualitative factors Longer-term focus monthsyears Best for buy-and hold investing Technical Analysis Looks at price and market trends to uncover market psychology Considers historical prices and chart patterns Shorter-term focus daysweeks Best for short-term or swing trading Limitations of Fundamental Analysis Though fundamental analysis can provide investors with insights into the future of a company, it does come with some downsides. Keep these items in mind when performing fundamental analysis Its Time-Consuming Fundamental analysis involves a detailed examination of financial statements, economic data, industry reports, and company-specific factors. This process requires collecting extensive data, performing complex calculations, and interpreting various financial metrics. Its A Lagging Indicator In addition to being a slow process, fundamental analysis often acts as a lagging indicator because it relies on financial data that reflects past performance. By the time changes in a companys fundamentals become apparent in its financial statements, the stock price might have already adjusted. Relies on Historical Data Similarly, fundamental analysis is based largely on historical financial information. While this data provides a basis for estimating future performance, it may not fully capture future risks or opportunities, as past performance is not an indicator of whats to come in the future. Subject to Accounting Practices The accuracy of fundamental analysis depends on the integrity and transparency of a companys financial statements. Factors like management estimates, depreciation, or other GAAP-compliant requirements can perhaps improperly impact the fundamental analysis. Difficult to Value Intangibles Intangible assets like patents, trademarks, brand reputation, and human capital are increasingly important in todays economy. However, these assets are challenging to quantify and may not be fully reflected in a companys financial statements. Consider how some investors would have believed in Apple simply because of Steve Jobs that notion is not captured in fundamental analysis. Economic Assumptions Fundamental analysis often involves assumptions about future economic conditions such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. Again, these are always changing and may not materialize as expected. Overlooked Short-Term Opportunities Fundamental analysis is geared towards long-term investment decisions, focusing on a companys intrinsic value and potential for growth over time. This long-term focus might cause investors to miss short-term trading opportunities that technical analysis can identify, such as price patterns, volume spikes, or momentum indicators. Example of Fundamental Analysis Lets analyze a hypothetical company called ABC Inc. using fundamental analysis. Well examine its financial statements and calculate key ratios to assess its financial health and performance. First, lets look at some data from ABC Inc.s financial statements for the previous fiscal year ABC Income Statement Balance Sheet Income Statement millions . Balance Sheet millions Revenue 1,000 . Assets Cost of Goods Sold 600 . Current Assets 750 Gross Profit 400 . Cash 200 Operating Expenses 200 . Marketable Securities 250 Operating Income 200 . Accounts Receivable 300 Net Income 150 . Non-Current Assets 750 . Total Assets 1,500 . ------------------ . Liabilities . Current Liabilities 250 . Non-Current Liabilities 250 . Total Liabilities 500 . . Shareholder Equity 1,000 ABC Statement of Cash Flows Stock Information Cash Flows from millions . Stock Information Operations 250 . Shares Outstanding 100 million Investments 100 . Stock Price 25.00 Financing 150 . Now, lets calculate some key ratios Profitability Ratios Gross profit margin 1,000 - 600 1,000 40 Operating profit margin 200 1,000 20 Net profit margin 150 1,000 15 Return on assets ROA 150 1,500 10 Return on equity ROE 150 1,000 15 ABC Inc.s profitability ratios suggest that the company is generating healthy profits from its operations. Its gross margin is 40, operating margin is 20, and net margin is 15. Its ROA and ROE of 10 and 15, respectively, indicate that the company is generating solid returns on its assets and equity. Liquidity Ratios Current ratio 750 250 3.00 Quick ratio 200 150 200 250 2.20 Assuming ABC Inc.s current assets are 750 million, with 200 million in cash, 150 million in marketable securities, and 200 million in accounts receivable, and its current liabilities are 250 million, the companys liquidity ratios are strong. A current ratio of 3.0 and a quick ratio of 2.2 suggest that ABC Inc. has ample liquidity to cover its short-term obligations. Solvency Ratios Debt-to-equity ratio 500 1,000 0.50 Debt-to-assets ratio 500 1,500 0.33 ABC Inc.s solvency ratios indicate that the company has a manageable level of debt relative to its equity and assets. A debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5 and a debt-to-assets ratio of 0.33 suggest that the company is not overly leveraged and has the financial flexibility to meet its long-term obligations. Valuation Ratios Assuming ABC Inc. has 100 million shares outstanding and its stock price is 25 per share Price-to-earnings PE Ratio 25 150 100 16.67 Price-to-book PB Ratio 25 1,000 100 2.50 Price-to-sales PS Ratio 25 1,000 100 2.50 ABC Inc.s valuation ratios suggest that the companys stock is trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its earnings, book value, and sales. A PE ratio of 16.67 aligns with the broader market, while PB and PS ratios of 2.5 indicate that the stock is not overly expensive relative to the companys assets and revenue. In addition to these quantitative measures, we can also consider certain qualitative fundamentals Competitive Advantages Has strong brand recognition in its industry and high customer loyalty Proprietary technology that differentiates its products from competitors Efficient supply chain and distribution network, enabling faster delivery and lower costs Management Quality It has an experienced management team with a proven track record of success. The CEO has been with the company for 15 years and has led the company through several periods of growth. Management has demonstrated a commitment to creating new goods and services and has strategic investments in research and development. Industry Trends The industry in which ABC Inc. operates is growing at a steady rate of 5 per year. Theres increasing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable products, which aligns with ABC Inc.s product offerings. The regulatory environment is becoming more favorable for the companys products. Growth Prospects ABC Inc. has a robust pipeline of new products set to launch in the next 12-18 months. The company has been expanding into new geographic markets and plans to enter two new countries next year. Recent acquisitions have provided opportunities for synergies and increased market share. Corporate Governance ABC Inc. has a diverse and independent board of directors. The company has a strong track record of transparency and timely financial reporting. Executive compensation is aligned with long-term shareholder interests. ESG Factors ABC Inc. has set ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint and increasing its use of renewable energy. The company is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, with programs in place to promote a diverse workforce. ABC Inc. engages with local communities and supports various philanthropic initiatives. Based on this hypothetical fundamental analysis, ABC Inc. appears to be a financially healthy and potentially attractive investment. However, its important to remember that this is just a simplified example. In practice, investors would need to conduct a more thorough analysis, considering the companys competitive position, industry trends, management quality, and growth prospects, before making an investment decision. What Is Fundamental Analysis and Its Objective? Fundamental analysis uses publicly available financial information and reports to determine whether a stock and the issuing company are valued correctly by the market. What Are the 3 Layers of Fundamental Analysis? When conducting an analysis, you can be top-down and start with economic analysis, then analyze the industry, then the company. Or, you can be bottom-up and work in the reverse order. What Are the Tools for Fundamental Analysis? Analysts use many tools. Some examples are financial reports, ratios from the reports, spreadsheets, charts, graphs, infographics, government agency reports on industries and the economy, and market reports. How Does Fundamental Analysis Differ From Technical Analysis? Fundamental analysis focuses on evaluating a securitys intrinsic value based on financial and economic factors, while technical analysis studies price movements and trading volumes to identify patterns and predict future price movements. Why Is Earnings Per Share EPS Important in Fundamental Analysis? EPS indicates a companys profitability on a per-share basis, helping investors determine how much profit a company generates for each share of its stock. It is a critical metric for assessing company performance and valuing stocks. The Bottom Line Fundamental analysis is used to value a company and determine whether a stock is over- or undervalued by the market. It considers the economic, market, sector-specific, and financial performance. Financial ratios generated from financial reports and government industry and economic reports are used to assess a company. Not every analyst uses the same tools or views stocks similarlyyou might determine a stock is valued differently than another analyst. Whats important is that the stock you analyze meets your criteria for value and that your analysis creates actionable information.",

    "text": "What Is an Investment Strategy? The term investment strategy refers to a set of principles designed to help an individual investor achieve their financial and investment goals. This plan is what guides an investors decisions based on goals, risk tolerance , and future needs for capital. They can vary from conservative where they follow a low-risk strategy where the focus is on wealth protection while others are highly aggressive seeking rapid growth by focusing on capital appreciation . Investors can use their strategies to formulate their own portfolios or do so through a financial professional. Strategies arent static, which means they need to be reviewed periodically as circumstances change. Key Takeaways An investment strategy is a plan designed to help individual investors achieve their financial and investment goals. Your investment strategy depends on your personal circumstances, including your age, capital, risk tolerance, and goals. Investment strategies range from conservative to highly aggressive, and include value and growth investing. You should reevaluate your investment strategies as your personal situation changes. Understanding Investment Strategies Investment strategies are styles of investing that help individuals meet their short- and long-term goals. Strategies depend on a variety of factors, including Age Goals Lifestyles Financial situations Available capital Personal situations family, living situation Expected returns This, of course, isnt an exhaustive list, and may include other details about the individual. These factors help an investor determine the kind of investments they choose to purchase, including stocks, bonds, money market funds , real estate, asset allocation , and how much risk they can tolerate. Investment strategies vary greatly. There isnt a one-size-fits-all approach to investing, which means there isnt one particular plan that works for everyone. This also means that people need to reevaluate and realign their strategies as they get older in order to adapt their portfolios to their situation. Investors can choose from value investing to growth investing and conservative to more risky approaches. As mentioned above, people can choose to make their investment decisions on their own or by using a financial professional. More experienced investors are able to make decisions and investment choices on their own. Keep in mind that there is no right way to manage a portfolio, but investors should behave rationally by doing their own research using facts and data to back up decisions by attempting to reduce risk and maintain sufficient liquidity . Important Because investment strategies depend so heavily on your personal situation and goals, its important for you to do your research before you commit your capital to any investment. Special Considerations Risk is a huge component of an investment strategy. Some individuals have a high tolerance for risk while other investors are risk-averse . Here are a few common risk-related rules Investors should only risk what they can afford to lose Riskier investments carry the potential for higher returns Investments that guarantee the preservation of capital also guarantee a minimal return For example, U.S. Treasury bonds , bills, and certificates of deposit CDs are considered safe because they are backed by the credit of the United States. However, these investments provide a low return on investment. Once the cost of inflation and taxes have been included in the return on income equation, there may be little growth in the investment. Along with risk, investors should also consider changing their investment strategies over time. For instance, a young investor saving for retirement may want to alter their investment strategy when they get older, shifting their choices from riskier investments to safer options. Types of Investment Strategies Investment strategies range from conservative plans to highly aggressive ones. A review of some of the top investors will show that there are a wide variety of strategies to consider. Conservative investment plans employ safe investments that come with low risks and provide stable returns. Highly aggressive ones are those that involve risky investments, such as stocks, options, and junk bonds , with the goal of generating maximum returns. People who have a greater investment horizon tend to employ aggressive plans because they have a longer timeline, while those who want to preserve capital are more likely to take a conservative approach. Many investors buy low-cost, diversified index funds, use dollar-cost averaging , and reinvest dividends . Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where a fixed dollar amount of stocks or a particular investment are acquired on a regular schedule regardless of the cost or share price. Some experienced investors, though, select individual stocks and build a portfolio based on individual firm analysis with predictions on share price movements. Value Investing vs. Growth Investing Some investors may choose strategies such as value and growth investing. With value investing, an investor chooses stocks that look as they though trade for less than their intrinsic value. This means that these stocks that the market is underestimating. Growth investing, on the other hand, involves investing capital in the stocks of junior companies that have the potential for earnings growth. Example of Investment Strategy A 25-year-old who starts off their career and begins saving for retirement may consider riskier investments because they have more time to invest and are more tolerant to risk They can also afford to lose some money in the event that the market takes a dive because they still have time earn more money. This means they can invest in things like stocks and real estate. A 45-year-old, on the other hand, doesnt have a lot of time to put money away for retirement and would be better off with a conservative plan. They may consider investing in things like bonds , government securities, and other safe bets. Meanwhile, someone saving for a vacation or home wont have the same strategy as someone saving for retirement. They may be better off putting their money away in a savings account or a CD for short-term goals like these.",

    "text": "Definition Diversification is the strategy of investing in different asset classes and asset types to reduce portfolio risk associated with price volatility. What Is Diversification? Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt to limit exposure to any single asset or risk . The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security. Key Takeaways Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in an attempt to reduce portfolio risk. Diversification is most often done by investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrency and then in different types of securities within a class. Diversification can also be achieved by purchasing investments in different countries, industries, sizes of companies, or term lengths for income-generating investments. The quality of diversification in a portfolio is most often measured by analyzing the correlation coefficient of pairs of assets. Investors can diversify on their own by investing in select investments or can hold diversified funds. Understanding Diversification Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness. Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the negative performance of others. The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences. Diversification Strategies As investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. Many of the methods below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio. Asset Classes Fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. Each asset class has a different, unique set of risks and opportunities. Classes can include Stocks Shares or equity in a publicly traded company Bonds Government and corporate fixed-income debt instruments Real estate Land, buildings, natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and water and mineral deposits Exchange-traded funds ETFs A marketable basket of securities that follow an index, commodity, or sector Commodities Basic goods necessary for the production of other products or services Cash and short-term cash-equivalents CCE Treasury bills, certificate of deposit CD, money market vehicles, and other short-term, low-risk investments The theory holds that what may negatively impact one asset class may benefit another. For example, rising interest rates usually negatively impact bond prices as yield must increase to make fixed income securities more attractive. On the other hand, rising interest rates may result in increases in rent for real estate or increases in prices for commodities. Tip Order your copy of Investopedias What To Do With 10,000 magazine for more wealth-building advice. IndustriesSectors There are tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. As investors diversify across various industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk. For example, consider the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. This legislation impacts many industries, though some companies are more affected than others. Semiconductor manufacturers will be largely impacted, while the financial services sector might feel smaller, residual impacts. Investors can diversify across industries by coupling investments that may counterbalance different businesses. For example, consider two major means of entertainment travel and digital streaming. Investors hoping to hedge against the risk of future major pandemic impacts may invest in digital streaming platforms positively impacted by more shutdowns. At the same time, they may consider simultaneously investing in airlines positively impacted by fewer shutdowns. In theory, these two unrelated industries may minimize overall portfolio risk. Important How many stocks do you need to own to be properly diversified? A study published in the Journal of Risk and Financial Management found there are simply too many variables to consider, and an optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist. Corporate Lifecycle Stages Growth vs. Value Public equities tend to be broken into two categories growth stocks and value stocks . Growth stocks are stocks in companies that are expected to experience profit or revenue growth greater than the industry average. Value stocks are stocks in companies that appear to be trading at a discount based on the current fundamentals of a company. Growth stocks tend to be more risky as the expected growth of a company may not materialize. For example, if the Federal Reserve constricts monetary policy, less capital is usually available or it is more expensive to borrow, creating a more difficult scenario for growth companies. However, growth companies may tap into seemingly limitless potential and exceed expectations, generating even greater returns than expected. On the other hand, value stocks tend to be more established, stable companies. While these companies may have already experienced most of their potential, they usually carry less risk. By diversifying into both, an investor would capitalize on the future potential of some companies while also recognizing the existing benefits of others. Market Capitalizations Large vs. Small Investors may want to consider investing across different securities based on the underlying market capitalization of the asset or company. Consider the vast operational differences between Apple and Newell Brands Inc. In July 2023, both companies were in the SP 500, with Apple representing 7.6 of the index and Newell Brands representing 0.0065. Each company will have a considerably different approach to raising capital, introducing new products to the market, brand recognition, and growth potential. Lower cap stocks have more room to grow, though higher cap stocks tend to be safer investments. Risk Profiles Across almost every asset class, investors can choose the underlying risk profile of the security. For example, consider fixed-income securities. An investor can choose to buy bonds from the top-rated governments in the world or from nearly defunct private companies raising emergency funds . There are considerable differences between several 10-year bonds based on the issuer, their credit rating, future operational outlook, and existing level of debt. The same can be said for other types of investments. Real estate development projects with more risk may carry greater upside than established operating properties. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies with longer histories and greater adoption, such as Bitcoin, carry less risk relative to smaller market cap coins or tokens. Tip Diversification may not be the best strategy for investors wanting to maximize their returns. Consider YOLO you only live once strategies where 100 of capital is placed in a high-risk investment. Though there is a higher probability of making life-changing money, there is also the highest probability of losing it due to poor diversification. Maturity Lengths Specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds, different term lengths impact risk profiles. Generally, the longer the maturity , the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bonds prices due to changes in interest rates. Short-term bonds tend to offer lower interest rates however, they also tend to be less impacted by uncertainty in future yield curves. Investors more comfortable with risk may consider adding longer term bonds that tend to pay higher degrees of interest. Maturity length is also prevalent in other asset classes. Consider the difference between short-term lease agreements for residential properties i.e., up to one year and long-term lease agreements for commercial properties i.e., sometimes five years or greater. Though there is more security in collecting rent revenue by locking into a long-term agreement, investors sacrifice flexibility to increase prices or change tenants. Physical Locations Foreign vs. Domestic Investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. For example, forces depressing the U.S. economy may not affect Japans economy in the same way. Therefore, holding Japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an American economic downturn. Alternatively, there may be a greater potential upside with associated higher degrees of risk when diversifying across developed and emerging countries. Consider Pakistans current classification as a frontier market participant recently downgraded from an emerging market participant. Investors willing to take on higher levels of risk may want to consider the higher growth potential of smaller yet-to-be-fully established markets such as Pakistan. Tangibility Financial instruments such as stocks and bonds are intangible investments they can not be physically touched or felt. On the other hand, tangible investments such as land, real estate, farmland, precious metals, or commodities can be touched and have real-world applications. These real assets have different investment profiles as they can be consumed, rented, developed, or treated differently than intangible or digital assets. There are also unique risks specific to tangible assets. Real property can be vandalized, physically stolen, damaged by natural conditions, or become obsolete. Real assets may also require storage, insurance, or security costs to carry. Though the revenue stream differs from financial instruments, the input costs to protect tangible assets are also different. Diversification Across Platforms Regardless of how an investor considers building their portfolio, another aspect of diversification relates to how those assets are held. Though this is not an implication of the investments risk, it is an additional risk worth considering as it may be diversifiable. For example, consider an individual with 400,000 of U.S. currency. In all three of the situations below, the investor has the same asset allocation. However, their risk profile is different The individual may deposit 200,000 at one bank and 200,000 at a second bank. Both deposits are under the FDIC insurance limit per bank and are fully insured. The individual may deposit 400,000 at a single bank. Only a portion of the deposit is covered by insurance. In addition, should that single bank experience a bank run, the individual may not have immediate access to cash. The individual may physically store 400,000 of cash in their home. Though immediately accessible, the individual will not yield any interest or growth on their cash. In addition, the individual may lose capital in the event of theft, fire, or by misplacing it. The same concept above relates to almost every asset class. For example, Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Investors holding cryptocurrency with the exchange experienced the inability to withdraw or transfer funds. Had investors diversified across platforms, the risk of loss would have been spread across different exchanges. Fast Fact Consider different strategies to offset technology risk and physical risk. For example, owning physical gold bars and gold ETFs diversifies your portfolio across various risks. If your physical holdings were to be stolen, at least 100 of your gold ownership was not lost. Diversification and Retail Investors Time and budget constraints can make it difficult for noninstitutional investorsi.e., individualsto create an adequately diversified portfolio. This challenge is a key to why mutual funds are so popular with retail investors. Buying shares in a mutual fund offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments. While mutual funds provide diversification across various asset classes, exchange-traded funds ETFs afford investor access to narrow markets, such as commodities and international plays, that would ordinarily be difficult to access. An individual with a 100,000 portfolio can spread the investment among ETFs with no overlap. There are several reasons why this is advantageous to investors. First, it may be too costly for retail investors to buy securities using different market orders. In addition, investors must then track their portfolios weight to ensure proper diversification. Though an investor sacrifices a say in all of the underlying companies being invested in, they simply choose an easier investment approach that prioritizes minimizing risk. Pros and Cons of Diversification The primary purpose of diversification is to mitigate risk. By spreading your investment across different asset classes, industries, or maturities, you are less likely to experience market shocks that impact every single one of your investments the same. There are other benefits to be had as well. Some investors may find diversification makes investing more fun as it encourages exploring different unique investments. Diversification may also increase the chance of hitting positive news. Instead of hoping for favorable news specific to one company, positive news impacting one of dozens of companies may benefit your portfolio. However, there are drawbacks to diversification. The more holdings a portfolio has, the more time-consuming it can be to manageand the more expensive, since buying and selling many different holdings incurs more transaction fees and brokerage commissions. More fundamentally, diversifications spreading-out strategy works both ways, lessening the risk and the reward. For instance, imagine youve invested 120,000 equally among six stocks, and one stock doubles in value. Your original 20,000 stake is now worth 40,000. Youve made a lot, sure, but not as much as if your entire 120,000 had been invested in that one company. By protecting you on the downside, diversification limits you on the upsideat least in the short term. Pros Reduces portfolio risk Hedges against market volatility Offers potentially higher returns long-term May be more enjoyable for investors to research new investments Cons Limits gains short-term Time-consuming to manage Incurs more transaction fees, commissions May be overwhelming for newer, unexperienced investors Diversifiable vs. Non-Diversifiable Risk The idea behind diversification is to minimize or even eliminate risk within a portfolio. However, there are certain types of risks you can diversify away, and certain types of risks exist regardless of how you diversify. These types of risks are called unsystematic and systematic risks . Consider the impact of COVID-19. Due to the global health crisis, many businesses stopped operating. Employees across many industries were laid off, and consumer spending across all sectors declined. On one hand, the economic slowdown negatively impacted almost every sector. On the other, nearly every sector then benefited from government intervention and monetary stimulus. The impact of COVID-19 on financial markets was systematic. In general, diversification aims to reduce unsystematic risk. These are the risks specific to an investment that are unique to that holding. Examples of diversifiable, non-systematic risks include Business risk The risk related to a specific company based on the nature of its company and what it does in the market. Financial risk The risks related to a specific company or organizations financial health, liquidity, and long-term solvency. Operational risk The risk related to breakdowns in manufacturing or goods distribution processes. Regulatory risk The risk that legislation may adversely impact the asset. Through diversification, investors strive to reduce the risks above, which are controllable based on the investments held. Measuring Diversification It can become complex and cumbersome to measure how diversified a portfolio is . In reality, it is impossible to calculate the actual degree of diversification there are simply too many variables to consider across too many assets to truly quantify a single measure of diversification. Still, analysts and portfolio managers use several measurements to get a rough idea of how diversified a portfolio is. Correlation Coefficient A correlation coefficient is a statistical measurement that compares the relationship between two variables. This statistical calculation tracks the movement of two assets and whether the assets tend to move in the same direction. The correlation coefficient result varies from -1 to 1, with interpretations ranging from Closer to -1 There is strong diversification between the two assets, as the investments move in opposite directions. There is a strong negative correlation between the two variables being analyzed. Closer to 0 There is moderate diversification between the two assets, as the investments have no correlation. The assets sometimes move together, while other times, they dont. Closer to 1 There is a strong lack of diversification between the two assets, as the investments move in the same direction. There is a strong positive correlation between the two variables being analyzed. Standard Deviation Standard deviation SD measures how often and far an outcome occurs away from the mean. For investments, standard deviation measures how far away from an assets average return other returns fall. Analysts use SD to estimate risk based on return frequency. For example, imagine two investments, each with an average annual return of 5. One has a high standard deviation, which means the investment returns can vary greatly. The other investment has a low standard deviation, meaning its returns have been closer to 5. The higher the standard deviation, the more risk there isbut there is a chance for higher returns. A portfolio full of investments with high standard deviations may have higher earning potential. However, these assets may be more likely to experience similar risks across asset classes. Smart Beta Smart beta strategies offer diversification by tracking underlying indices but do not necessarily weigh stocks according to their market cap. ETF managers further screen equity issues on fundamentals and rebalance portfolios according to objective analysis, not just company size. While smart beta portfolios are unmanaged, the primary goal becomes the outperformance of the index itself. CountWeighting In its most basic form, a portfolios diversification can be measured by counting the number of assets or determining the weight of each asset. When counting the number of assets, consider the number of each type for the strategies above. For example, an investor can count that of the 20 equities they hold, 15 are in the technology sector. Alternatively, investors can measure diversification by allocating percentages to what they are invested in. So, in this view, the investor with 15 equities in tech has 75 of their equity holdings in a single industry. On a broader portfolio basis, investors more often compare equity, bonds, and alternative assets to create their diversification targets. For example, traditional portfolios tended to skew towards 60 equities and 40 bondsthough some strategies call for different diversification based on age. Other theories claim that holding alternative assets has added benefits for example, 60 equities, 20 bonds, and 20 alternatives. Example of Diversification Imagine an aggressive investor , who can assume a higher risk level, wishes to construct a portfolio composed of Japanese equities, Australian bonds, and cotton futures. They could purchase stakes in the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, the Vanguard Australian Government Bond Index ETF, and the iPath Bloomberg Cotton Subindex Total Return ETN. With this mix of ETF shares, due to the specific qualities of the targeted asset classes and the transparency of the holdings, the investor ensures true diversification in their holdings. Also, with different correlations, or responses to outside forces, among the securities, they can slightly lessen their risk exposure. What Are the Benefits of Diversification? In theory, holding investments that are different from each other reduces the overall risk of the assets youre invested in. If something bad happens to one investment, youre more likely to have assets that are not impacted if you were diversified. Diversification may result in a larger profit if you are extended into asset classes you wouldnt otherwise have invested in. Also, some investors find diversification more enjoyable to pursue as they research new companies, explore different asset classes, and own different types of investments. What Are the Methods of Diversification? There are many different ways to diversify the primary method of diversification is to buy different types of asset classes. For example, instead of putting your entire portfolio into public stock, you may consider buying some bonds to offset some market risk of stocks. In addition to investing in different asset classes, you can diversify into different industries, geographical locations, term lengths, or market caps. The primary goal of diversification is to invest in a broad range of assets that face different risks. Is Diversification a Good Strategy? For investors seeking to minimize risk, diversification is a strong strategy. That said, diversification may minimize returns, as the goal of diversification is to reduce the risk within a portfolio. By reducing risk, an investor is willing to take less profit in exchange for the preservation of capital. The Bottom Line Diversification is a very important concept in financial planning and investment management. It is the idea that by investing in different things, the overall risk of your portfolio is lower. Instead of putting all your money into a single asset, spreading your wealth across different assets puts you at less risk of losing capital. With the ease of transacting and investing online, it is now incredibly easy to diversify your portfolio through different asset classes and other strategies.",

    "text": "Definition The term asset allocation refers to the process of dividing a financial or investment portfolio between different assets classes. Asset allocation is how investors divide their portfolios among different assets that might include equities, fixed-income assets, and cash and its equivalents. Investors ordinarily aim to balance risks and rewards based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and the investment horizon. Key Takeaways Asset allocation is how investors split up their portfolios among different kinds of assets. The three main asset classes are equities, fixed income, and cash and cash equivalents. Each asset class has different risks and return potential, so each will behave differently over time. No simple formula can find the right asset allocation for every individual investor. Investopedia Joules Garcia Why Is Asset Allocation Important? Theres no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone, but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors make. Selecting individual securities within an asset class is done only after you decide how to divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. This will largely determine your investment results. Investors use different asset allocations for distinct goals. Someone saving to buy a new car in the next year might invest those savings in a conservative mix of cash, certificates of deposit, and short-term bonds . However, individuals saving for retirement decades away typically invest most of their retirement accounts in stocks because they have a lot of time to ride out the markets short-term fluctuations. Fast Fact Risk tolerance plays a key factor as well. Those uncomfortable investing in stocks may put their money in a more conservative asset class despite having a long-term investment horizon. Age-Based Asset Allocation Financial advisors generally recommend holding stocks for five years or longer. Cash and money market accounts are appropriate for goals less than a year away. Bonds fall somewhere in between. Financial advisors once recommended subtracting an investors age from 100 to determine what percentage should be invested in stocks. A 40-year-old would, therefore, be 60 invested in stocks. Variations of this rule recommend subtracting age from 110 or 120, given that average life expectancy continues to grow. Portfolios should generally move to a more conservative asset allocation to help lower risk as individuals approach retirement. Asset Allocation Through Life-Cycle Funds Some asset-allocation mutual funds are known as life-cycle or target-date funds. They set out to provide investors with portfolios that address their age, risk appetite, and investment goals with the correlated parts of different asset classes. Critics of this approach point out that a standardized solution for allocating portfolio assets is wrongheaded because individual investors require individual solutions. These funds gradually reduce the risk in their portfolios as they near the target date, cutting riskier stocks and adding safer bonds to preserve the nest egg. The Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 is an example of a target-date fund. The Vanguard 2030 fund is for people expecting to retire just before or after 2030. As of Aug. 31, 2023, its portfolio comprises 63 stocks, 36 bonds, and 1 short-term reserves. This asset allocation was achieved by investing in the following four funds Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund How Do Economic Changes Affect Asset Allocation Strategies? Economic cycles of growth and contraction greatly affect how you should allocate your assets. During bull markets, investors ordinarily prefer growth-oriented assets like stocks to profit from better market conditions. Alternatively, during downturns or recessions, investors tend to shift toward more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents, which can help preserve capital. What Is an Asset Allocation Fund? An asset allocation fund provides investors with a diversified portfolio of investments across various asset classes. The asset allocation of the fund can be fixed or variable among a mix of asset classes. It may be held to fixed percentages of asset classes or allowed to lean further on some, depending on market conditions. What Is a Good Asset Allocation? What works for one person might not work for another. There is no such thing as a perfect asset allocation model. A good asset allocation varies by individual and can depend on various factors, including age, financial targets, and appetite for risk. Historically, an asset allocation of 60 stocks and 40 bonds was considered optimal. However, some professionals say this idea needs to be revised, particularly given the poorer performance of bonds in recent years, and say other asset classes should also be introduced to portfolios. What Is the Best Asset Allocation Strategy for My Age? Generally, the younger and further you are from needing to access the capital invested, the more you should invest in stocks. One common guideline thats ordinarily quoted is that you should hold a percentage of stocks that is equal to 100 minus your age. So, if you are 30, 70 of your portfolio should supposedly consist of stocks. The rest would then be allocated to safer assets, such as bonds . But a lot of these rules dont work for everyone. For advice that reflects your personal circumstances, reach out to a financial advisor. How Does Behavioral Finance View Asset Allocation? Behavioral finance explores how common cognitive errors might influence our financial choices. For our asset allocation, we might be swayed too much by recent market trends, overconfidence, sunk-cost reasoning, or loss aversion, which can lead to less beneficial allocation choices. Awareness of these cognitive biases can help you keep a disciplined, long-term approach aligned with your goals. The Bottom Line Most financial professionals will tell you that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors can make. The selection of individual securities is secondary to how assets are allocated in stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents, which will play more of a role in your investment results.",

    "text": "What Is Rebalancing? Rebalancing refers to the process of returning the values of a portfolios asset allocations to the levels defined by an investment plan . Those levels are intended to match an investors tolerance for risk and desire for reward. Over time, asset allocations can change as market performance alters the values of the assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling the assets in a portfolio to regain and maintain that original, desired level of asset allocation . Take a portfolio with an original target asset allocation of 50 stocks and 50 bonds. If the stocks prices rose during a certain period of time, their higher value could increase their allocation proportion within the portfolio to, say, 70. The investor may then decide to sell some stocks and buy bonds to realign the percentages back to the original target allocation of 50-50. Key Takeaways Rebalancing is the act of adjusting a portfolios changed asset allocation to match an original allocation defined by an investors risk and reward profile. There are several types of strategies for rebalancing, such as calendar, constant-mix, and portfolio-insurance. Calendar rebalancing is the least costly but is not responsive to market fluctuations. The constant-mix strategy is responsive but more costly to use than calendar rebalancing. Costs of rebalancing can include transaction fees, inadvertent exposure to higher risk, and selling assets as they are increasing in value. How Rebalancing Works Portfolio rebalancing aims to protect investors from exposure to undesirable risks while providing exposure to reward. It can also ensure that a portfolios exposure remains within the portfolio managers area of expertise. There are times when a stocks price performance can vary more dramatically than that of bonds. Therefore, a portfolios percentage of equity-related assets should be assessed as market conditions change. If the value of equities in a portfolio causes the allocation in stocks to rise above their preset percentage, a rebalancing may be in order. That would involve selling some shares of stock to lower the overall percentage of equities in the portfolio. Investors may also wish to adjust their overall portfolio risk to meet changing financial needs. For instance, an investor who needs a greater potential for return might increase the allocation in assets that involve higher risk, such as equities, to improve that potential. Or, if income becomes more important than it was before, the allocation of bonds could be increased. Some investors may mistakenly understand rebalancing to refer to adjusting for an even distribution of assets. However, a 50-50 stock and bond split is not required. A portfolios target allocation of assets just as easily could be 70 stocks and 30 bonds, 40 stocks and 60 bonds, or 10 cash, 40 stocks, and 50 bonds. The allocation depends on the goals and needs of an investor. When to Rebalance While there is no required schedule for rebalancing a portfolio , its recommended that investors examine allocations at least once every year. Investors dont have to rebalance but generally, thats ill-advised. Rebalancing gives investors the opportunity to sell high and buy low, taking the gains from high-performing investments and reinvesting them in areas that are expected to see notable growth. Important An investment planwhere asset allocations and rebalancing are definedcan range from a simple idea or strategy created by an individual to a multi-page package developed by a portfolio manager. An investment plan can help ensure that every investor takes needed actions, including rebalancing, and avoids inappropriate steps that could affect a portfolios return negatively. Types of Rebalancing Calendar Rebalancing Calendar rebalancing is the most rudimentary rebalancing approach. This strategy involves analyzing and adjusting the investment holdings within the portfolio at predetermined times. Many long-term investors rebalance once a year. Other types of investors with different outlooks and goals may rebalance quarterly, or even monthly. Weekly rebalancing could be overly expensive and unnecessary. The ideal frequency of rebalancing must be determined based on an investors time constraints, threshold for transaction costs, and allowance for value drift. Advantages of calendar rebalancing over more responsive methods are that it is less time consuming and costly for the investor since it involves fewer rebalancing occasions and potentially fewer trades. However, a downside is that it does not call for rebalancing at other dates even if the market moves significantly. Constant-Mix Rebalancing A more responsive approach to rebalancing focuses on the allowable percentage composition of an asset in a portfolio. This is known as a constant-mix strategy with bands or corridors. Every asset class , or individual security, is given a target weight and a corresponding tolerance range. For example, an allocation strategy might include the requirement to hold 30 in emerging market equities, 30 in domestic blue chips and 40 in government bonds with a corridor of - 5 for each asset class. Therefore, emerging market and domestic blue chip holdings can both fluctuate between 25 and 35. At the same time, 35 to 45 of the portfolio must be allocated to government bonds. When the weight of any one holding moves outside of its allowable band, the entire portfolio is rebalanced to reflect the initial target composition. Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance The most intensive rebalancing strategy commonly used is constant proportion portfolio insurance CPPI is a type of portfolio insurance that allows the investor to set a floor on the dollar value of their portfolio and structure the asset allocation on it. The asset classes in CPPI are styled as a risky asset, such as equities or mutual funds, and a conservative asset of either cash, cash equivalents, or treasury bonds. The percentage allocated to each depends on a cushion value, defined as the current portfolio value minus some floor value, and a multiplier coefficient. The greater the multiplier number, the more aggressive the rebalancing strategy. The outcome of the CPPI strategy is somewhat similar to that of buying a synthetic call option that does not use actual option contracts. CPPI is sometimes referred to as a convex strategy. Smart Beta Rebalancing Smart beta rebalancing is a periodic rebalancing similar to the regular rebalancing that indexes undergo to adjust to changes in stock value and market capitalization. Smart beta strategies take a rules-based approach to avoid the market inefficiencies that creep into index investing due to the reliance on market capitalization. Smart beta rebalancing uses additional criteria, such as value as defined by performance measures like book value or return on capital, to allocate the holdings across a selection of stocks. This rules-based method of portfolio creation adds a layer of systematic analysis to the investment that simple index investing lacks. Although smart beta rebalancing is more active than simply using index investing to mimic the overall market, it is less active than stock picking. One of the key features of smart beta rebalancing is that emotions are taken out of the process. Depending on how the rules are set up, an investor may end up trimming exposure to their top performers and increasing exposure to less stellar performers. This runs counter to the old adage of letting your winners run , but the periodic rebalancing realizes the profits regularly rather than trying to time market sentiment for maximum profit. Smart beta can also be used to rebalance across asset classes if the proper parameters are set. In this case, the risk-weighted returns are often used to compare different types of investments and adjust exposure accordingly. Examples of Rebalancing Rebalancing Retirement Accounts One of the most common areas investors look to rebalance is the allocations within their retirement accounts . Asset performance impacts the overall value, and many investors prefer to invest more aggressively at younger ages and more conservatively as they approach retirement age. Often, the portfolio is at its most conservative once the investor prepares to draw out the funds to supply retirement income. So, over the years, a portfolio may be rebalanced to reflect an increasingly greater allocation in fixed income securities . Rebalancing for Diversification Depending on market performance, investors may find a large number of assets held within one area. For example, should the value of stock X increase by 25 while stock Y only gained 5, a large amount of the value in the portfolio is tied to stock X. Should stock X experience a sudden downturn, the portfolio will suffer higher losses by association. Rebalancing lets the investor redirect some of the funds currently held in stock X to another investment, be that more of stock Y or purchasing a new stock entirely. By having funds spread out across multiple stocks, a downturn in one will be partially offset by the activities of the others, which can provide a level of portfolio stability. Advantages and Disadvantages of Rebalancing Advantages Rebalancing can keep investors portfolios aligned with their risk tolerance and need for a certain amount of return. It maintains a pre-determined asset allocation set by an investment plan. Its a disciplined, unemotional investment approach that can reduce exposure to risk. It can be changed as investors financial needs and investment goals change. Rebalancing can be done by experienced individual investors or handled by portfolio managers. Disadvantages Rebalancing involves transaction costs, which may reduce net income. Selling securities that have increased in value to rebalance a portfolio might lead to investors missing out on an upward price trend of those securities. Investing knowledge and experience is required to rebalance as needed and reduce exposure to risk appropriately. Unnecessary rebalancing can increase costs for an investor. What Does Rebalancing a Portfolio Mean? It means selling and buying the necessary securities to bring the value of each allocation in a portfolio back to the level established by an investment plan. Does Rebalancing Have Costs? Yes, it does. It involves the fees related to the transactions to purchase and sell securities. It can also involve the cost of performance. For example, to rebalance, you might sell securities that have increased in value and pushed your allocations out of whack. However, you could miss out on a continued upswing in prices that those securities experience. By making rebalancing part of an investment plan that you commit to, youll be aware of and can accept these and other potential costs in advance. How Often Should I Rebalance? That depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial needs. For example, long-term investors who take a buy and hold approach to the markets might consider reviewing their allocations once a year with their financial advisors to see if rebalancing is warranted. Other investors with shorter-term goals may wish to rebalance more frequently to be sure they stay on track to meet those goals.",

    "text": "Definition Portfolio management is the art of selecting and overseeing a group of investments that meet the long-term financial objectives and risk tolerance of a client, a company, or an institution. Portfolio management is the process of balancing risk against performance , determining the right mix of assets to optimize returns for the amount of risk youre willing to accept. While many people manage their own investment portfolios, many rely on professional portfolio managers. Regardless of approach, successfully managing a portfolio requires an in-depth understanding of the key building blocks that drive investment success, including thoughtful asset allocation, proper diversification , and disciplined rebalancing practices. Key Takeaways Portfolio management involves building and overseeing a selection of assets such as stocks, bonds, and cash that meet an investors long-term financial goals and risk tolerance. Active portfolio management requires strategically buying and selling stocks and other assets to beat the broader markets performance. Passive portfolio management seeks to match the markets returns by mimicking the makeup of an index or indexes. Investors can carry out strategies to aggressively pursue profits, conservatively attempt to preserve capital or a blend of both. Portfolio management requires having clear long-term goals, understanding any tax-code changes from the Internal Revenue Service IRS, knowledge of the investors risk tolerance, and a willingness to examine investment options. Understanding Portfolio Management Professional licensed portfolio managers work on behalf of clients, while individuals can build and manage their portfolios. In either case, the portfolio managers ultimate goal is to maximize the investments expected return within an appropriate level of risk exposure. Portfolio management requires the ability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a spectrum of investments. These choices involve trade-offs, from debt versus equity to domestic versus international and growth versus safety. Key Terms in Portfolio Management, With Examples Term Definition Examples Active Management A strategy where portfolio managers actively buy and sell securities in an attempt to outperform a benchmark. A fund manager might overweight technology stocks believing the sector will outperform the market. Alpha The excess return of an investment relative to its benchmark. An alpha of 1 means the investment outperformed its benchmark by 1. Asset Allocation The distribution of assets e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate within a portfolio to achieve a preferred risk-return profile. Conservative investors often have a higher allocation of bonds, while aggressive investors want more exposure to growth stocks. Asset Class A group of investments with similar characteristics e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate. A diversified portfolio might include multiple asset classes. Benchmark A standard against which the performance of an investment or portfolio is measured. A common benchmark for U.S. stocks is the SP 500 index. Beta A measure of an investments volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1 means the investment moves in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility. Diversification Spreading investments across assets to lower risk. Owning stocks from different industries or countries. Index Fund A type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund ETF that tracks the performance of a specific market index The SP 500 index , which tracks the largest 500 American publicly traded companies in terms of market capitalization. Liquidity The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. Stocks and ETFs are considered more liquid than real estate. Net Asset Value NAV The value per share of a mutual fund or ETF on a specific date or time. The NAV of a mutual fund fluctuates daily based on the market value of its underlying holdings. Passive Management A strategy that aims to replicate the performance of a benchmark index, often through investing in index funds or ETFs. An investor might choose a passive SP 500 index fund to mirror the performance of the U.S. large-cap market. Portfolio Optimization The process of selecting the best portfolio asset allocation given the investors constraints and objectives. Modern portfolio theory is a common approach to portfolio optimization. Rebalancing Adjusting a portfolios asset allocation back to its target percentages to maintain the desired risk-return profile. Selling some stocks and buying more bonds to return to a target allocation of 60 stocks and 40 bonds. Risk Tolerance An investors ability and willingness to withstand changes in the value of their holdings. An investor with a high-risk tolerance might be comfortable with a portfolio of mostly stocks. Risk-Return Tradeoff The principle that potential returns rise with an increase in risk. Thus, lower-risk investments offer lower potential returns, while higher-risk investments offer higher potential returns. Stocks are generally considered riskier than bonds, but they also have the potential for higher returns. Sharpe Ratio A measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated as the excess return of an investment over the risk-free rate divided by its standard deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Tracking Error The difference between the performance of a portfolio and the performance of its benchmark index. A tracking error of 1 means the portfolios return deviated from the benchmarks return by 1. Turnover The percentage of a portfolios holdings that are sold and replaced over a specific period. A high turnover rate can result in higher transaction costs and have tax implications. Volatility The degree of variation in prices over time for a given asset. Stocks with high volatility experience larger price swings than those with low volatility. Who Uses Portfolio Management Portfolio management is a critical investment practice used by two types of entities individual and institutional investors . These categories have distinct strategies, goals, and resources. Understanding the different approaches and needs of these two types of investors can provide greater insight into how portfolio management techniques are applied across the financial spectrum. Individual investors often focus on personal wealth and future needs , managing smaller amounts of money with varying degrees of professional assistance. In contrast, institutional investors manage large-scale assets with a professional approach tailored to fulfill specific financial obligations and institutional goals. Both groups, however, aim to improve their returns by managing their portfolios to suit specific circumstances and financial objectives. Individual Investors Individual investors have a range of personal goals, risk preferences, and resources. Their objectives include saving for retirement, accumulating wealth for large purchases, funding education for children, or building an emergency fund. Each goal requires a different strategy or risk profile. Individual investors risk tolerance and investment knowledge vary greatly. Their approach to managing investments can range from highly engaged active trading and rebalancing to relying on automated or professional management. As financial markets have evolved and technology has widened access to investment information, individual investors have had wider prospects to tailor their investment strategies to meet their financial objectives. Institutional Investors Institutional investors are entities that pool large sums of money and invest those funds into various financial instruments and assets pension funds, endowments, foundations, banks, and insurance companies. Each has specific objectives and constraints that influence its portfolio management strategies. Many institutional investors have long-term financial obligations that cause them to focus on long-term growth and sustainability over short-term gains. In addition, institutional investors are often under strict regulatory oversight to ensure they manage their beneficiaries funds responsibly. Moreover, ethical and social governance issues increasingly influence their investment decisions. Risk management is a crucial part of the work of an institutional portfolio manager since these entities must balance the need for profitability with the imperative of preserving capital to meet future liabilities. Institutional investors investment approaches are typically conservative compared with individual investors, focusing on long-term stability, capital preservation, and meeting future obligations. Indeed, each type of institutional investor has distinct strategies and objectives, but all share the common goal of responsibly managing large pools of capital to meet the needs of their stakeholders. Passive vs. Active Management Portfolio management can be either passive or active. Active vs. Passive Portfolio Management Active Management Approach Hands-on Cost Implications More costly Performance Historically, over long periods, underperforms Passive Management Approach Hands-off Cost Implications Less costly Performance Historically, over long periods, performs like the market Passive management is the set-it-and-forget-it long-term strategy. It may involve investing in one or more ETFs. This is commonly referred to as indexing or index investing . Those who build indexed portfolios may use modern portfolio theory to help them optimize the mix. Active management involves attempting to beat an indexs performance by actively buying and selling individual stocks and other assets. Closed-end funds and many mutual funds are generally actively managed. Active managers may use any of a wide range of quantitative or qualitative models to aid in their evaluation of potential investments. Active Portfolio Management Investors who use an active management approach have fund managers or brokers to buy and sell stocks in an attempt to outperform a specific index, such as the Standard Poors 500 Index or the Russell 1000 Index. Often, these investors will also use portfolio management software to help them track their investments. An actively managed investment fund has an individual portfolio manager, co-managers, or a team of managers actively making investment decisions for the fund. The success of an actively managed fund depends on a combination of in-depth research, market forecasting, and the expertise of the portfolio manager or management team. Portfolio managers engaged in active investing pay close attention to market trends , shifts in the economy, changes to the political landscape, and news that affects companies. This data is used to time the purchase or sale of investments to take advantage of market irregularities. Active managers claim that these processes will boost the potential for returns higher than those achieved by simply tracking the holdings on a particular index. Trying to beat the market inevitably involves market risk. Indexing eliminates this particular risk, as there is less probability of human error in selecting the index stocks. Index funds are also traded less often, which means that they incur lower expense ratios and are more tax-efficient than actively managed funds. Passive Portfolio Management Passive portfolio management, also known as index fund management, aims to duplicate the return of a particular market index or benchmark. Managers buy the same stocks listed on the index, using the same weighting that they represent in the index. A passive strategy portfolio can be structured as an ETF, a mutual fund, or a unit investment trust. Index funds are branded as passively managed because each has a portfolio manager whose job is to replicate the index rather than select the assets bought or sold. Management fees assessed on passive portfolios or funds are typically far lower than those of active management strategies. Discretionary vs. Non-Discretionary Management Another critical element of portfolio management is the concept of discretionary and non-discretionary management . This approach dictates what a third party may be allowed to do regarding your portfolio. A discretionary or non-discretionary management style is only relevant if you have an independent broker managing your portfolio. If you want the broker to execute trades that you have explicitly approved, you must opt for a non-discretionary investment account. The broker may advise you on strategy and suggest investment moves. However, without your approval, the broker is simply an advisor who must follow your instructions. Meanwhile, some investors would prefer to leave all decisions to their broker or financial manager. In these situations, the financial advisor can buy or sell securities without the investors approval. However, the advisor still has a fiduciary responsibility to act in the clients best interest when managing their portfolio. Key Elements of Portfolio Management Asset Allocation The key to effective portfolio management is the long-term mix of assets . Generally, that means stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents such as certificates of deposit. There are others, called alternative investments, such as real estate, commodities, derivatives, and cryptocurrency. Asset allocation is based on the understanding that different types of assets do not move in concert, and some are more volatile than others. A mix of assets provides balance and protects against risk. Investors with a more aggressive profile weigh their portfolios more toward volatile investments such as growth stocks. Investors with a conservative profile weigh their portfolios toward stabler investments such as bonds and blue chip stocks . Important Rebalancing captures recent gains and opens new prospects while keeping the portfolio in line with its original risk-return profile. Diversification The only certainty in investing is that it is impossible to consistently predict winners and losers. The prudent approach is to create a basket of investments that provides broad exposure across different assets. Diversification involves spreading the risk and reward of individual securities within an asset class or between asset classes. Because it is difficult to know which subset of an asset class or sector is likely to outperform another, diversification seeks to capture the returns of different sectors over time while reducing volatility. Real diversification is made across various classes of securities, sectors of the economy, and geographical regions. Rebalancing Rebalancing returns a portfolio to its original target allocation at regular intervals, usually annually. It reinstates the original asset mix when market movements push it out of kilter. For example, a portfolio that starts with a 70 equity and 30 fixed-income allocation could, after an extended market rally, shift to an 8020 allocation. Investors have made a good profit, but the portfolio now has more risk than investors with that balance can tolerate. Rebalancing generally involves selling high-priced securities and investing the money in lower-priced and out-of-favor securities. This annual exercise allows investors to capture gains and expand their chances for growth in high-potential sectors while keeping the portfolio aligned with the original risk-return profile. Tax-Efficiency A potentially material aspect of portfolio management relates to how your portfolio is shaped to minimize taxes over the long term. This is relevant for retirement accounts, as well as how long you plan to hold certain assets and which ones you choose. For example, certain bonds may be tax-exempt. This means that any interest earned is not subject to taxes. Meanwhile, the IRS has different tax rules for short-term and long-term capital gains. For single filers and married couples filing separately earning less than 48,350 in 2025, their capital gains rate may be 0. Meanwhile, a long-term capital gains tax of 15 applies if your income is above this threshold but below 533,400 for single filers. For incomes above 533,400 single filers or 600,050 married filing jointly, the rate increases to 20. Fast Fact Portfolios include investments across cash accounts, 401ks, IRAs, and other retirement accounts. Common Portfolio Management Strategies Every investors specific situation is unique. Therefore, while some investors may be risk-averse, others may be inclined to pursue the greatest returns while also incurring the greatest risk. Very broadly speaking, here are several common portfolio management strategies an investor can consider Aggressive An aggressive portfolio prioritizes maximizing its potential earnings. Often invested in riskier industries or unproven alternative assets, investors may be willing to risk losses. Instead, investors are looking for a home run investment by striking it big with a single investment. Conservative Meanwhile, a conservative portfolio relates to capital preservation. Extremely risk-averse investors may adopt a portfolio management strategy that minimizes growth and the risk of losses. Moderate A moderate portfolio management strategy blends an aggressive and conservative approach. To get the best of both worlds, a moderate portfolio still invests heavily in equities but also diversifies and may be more selective about which equities it invests in. Income-oriented This is often the option of choice for retired investors, who wish to live off their portfolio returns. These returns could come from bond coupons or dividends. Tax efficiency As discussed above, investors may be inclined to focus primarily on minimizing taxes, even at the expense of higher returns. This may be especially important for high earners in the highest income tax bracket. It may also be a priority for young investors who have a very long way to go until retirement. By getting started with a Roth IRA , these investors can grow their portfolio over time and face no federal taxes on these funds when they retire. The Retirement Security Rule When building and managing investment portfolios, its crucial to understand the regulatory environment that governs financial advice. One significant aspect of this landscape is the Department of Labors April 2024 fiduciary rule, known as the Retirement Security Rule , which has been undergoing legal challenges since its introduction. The Retirement Security Rule was finalized in April 2024 and originally scheduled to take effect on Sept. 23, 2024. However, in July 2024, two Federal District Courts in Texas issued orders blocking implementation, ruling that industry trade groups would likely prevail in their argument that the DOL exceeded its authority. The Department of Justice filed an appeal to the Fifth Circuit, but following the change in presidential administrations in January 2025, the DOL filed a motion to pause the litigation, effectively putting the rules future in doubt. As such, the financial services industry remains subject to the previous five-part test from a 1975 DOL regulation. Under this standard, professionals are considered fiduciaries when providing investment advice if they meet all of the following criteria Renders advice The individual renders advice about the value of securities or other property, or makes recommendations on investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or other property. Regularity The advice is provided regularly. Mutual agreement There is a mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding with the plan or a plan fiduciary that the advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions. Individualized advice The advice is individualized based on the particular needs of the plan. Primary basis for decisions The advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions. This standard has been criticized for being too narrow, potentially allowing some financial professionals to avoid fiduciary responsibility even when providing important investment recommendations. These developments underscore the importance of individual investors understanding the nature of their relationship with financial advisors. Its crucial to know whether your advisor is acting as a fiduciary and what standards of care they are required to meet when providing investment advice, particularly for retirement accounts. Challenges of Portfolio Management Whatever strategy is chosen, portfolio management always faces several hurdles that often cant be eliminated entirely. Even if an investor has a foolproof portfolio management strategy, investment portfolios are subject to market fluctuations and volatility. The best management approach can still suffer from significant losses. Though diversification is an important aspect of portfolio management, it can also be challenging to achieve. Finding the right mix of asset classes and investments to balance risk and return requires an in-depth understanding of the market and the investors risk tolerance. Buying a wide range of securities may also be expensive to meet the desired diversification. To devise the best portfolio management strategy, an investor must first know their risk tolerance, investment horizon , and return expectations. This requires a clear short-term and long-term goal. Because life circumstances can quickly and rapidly change, investors must be mindful of how some strategies limit liquidity or flexibility. In addition, the IRS may change tax regulations, forcing you to change your investment strategy. Lastly, portfolio managers charge fees. The portfolio manager must often meet specific regulatory reporting requirements, and managers may not have the same views of the market as you do. How Do I Determine My Risk Tolerance? This is influenced by your financial goals, investment time horizon, income, and personal comfort with risk. Tools like risk tolerance questionnaires can help quantify your risk tolerance by asking about your reactions to hypothetical market scenarios and your investment preferences. In addition, thinking back to your past investment experiences and consulting with a financial advisor can provide a clearer understanding of the kinds of investments that are right for you in terms of your risk tolerance. What Is Asset Allocation? Asset allocation involves spreading the investors money among different asset classes so that risks are reduced and opportunities for profit are maximized. Stocks, bonds, and cash are the three most common asset classes, but others include real estate, commodities, currencies, and crypto. Within each of these are subclasses that play into a portfolio allocation . What Should I Do If My Portfolio Has Significant Losses? If this happens, its important to avoid panic selling and instead assess the situation calmly. Start by reviewing your investment strategy to ensure it still aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. Consider whether the losses are because of market volatility or fundamental changes in the assets you hold. Rebalancing your portfolio might be necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation. Diversifying your investments can also help mitigate future risks. Consulting with a financial advisor can give you guidance and help you make informed decisions about how to recover from your losses and adjust your strategy if needed. How Do I Evaluate How My Portfolio Is Doing? Evaluating the performance of your portfolio involves comparing its returns against benchmarks typically indexes that offer a mix like youre aiming for in your portfolio and considering your investment goals. Data to review include total return , your risk-adjusted return, and the performance of individual assets relative to their respective indexes. Its also important to review the consistency of your returns over time and whether your portfolio is making progress toward your objectives. The Bottom Line Anyone who wants to grow their money has choices to make. You can be your own investment portfolio manager, or you can hire a professional to do it for you. You can choose a passive management strategy by putting your money in index funds. You can also try to beat the markets by actively managing your portfolio. Youll want to pay attention to the basics of portfolio management pick a mix of assets to lower your overall risk, diversify your holdings to maximize your potential returns, and rebalance your portfolio regularly to keep the mix right.",

Investing is one of the key strategies to building long-term wealth and financial security. A Beginners Guide to Investing Investing An Introduction By Peter Gratton Updated Feb 06, 2025 What Are Stock Fundamentals? By Ben McClure Updated Jul 09, 2023 How To Start Investing in Stocks in 2025 and Beyond By Peter Gratton Updated Dec 03, 2024 How Do I Keep Commissions and Fees From Eating Trading Profits? By Chris Gallant Updated Apr 03, 2024 4 Basic Things To Know About Bonds By Eric Fontinelle Updated Apr 28, 2025 Frequently Asked Questions Can I start investing with 1000? Yes, many brokerages have no minimum account size and will offer zero-commission trading, allowing you to begin investing with even very small amounts. In fact, now with many brokers offering fractional shares, you can invest in stocks even if their share price is over 1000. Learn More How to Invest 1,000 How do I invest in stocks? While there are many ways to invest in stocks, one of the easiest and best ways for beginning investors to do so is to open up a retirement account with a discount broker. These accounts have tax advantages when saving for retirement and many different brokers have ones that cost little or even nothing to have. Learn More Best Investment Accounts for Young Investors How can I invest with no money? While you cant invest with zero money, you can invest with very little. Many stock brokers offer accounts with no minimum balance and no trading commissions so almost any amount you add to your account can be used to invest. Learn More How to Invest When Youre Broke Why should I invest? You should invest because investing allows your savings to go farther than they otherwise would. Simply holding your savings as cash means it will just sit and be slowly diluted by inflation, whereas even in the safest investments it will earn some money for you, building on itself. Learn More Why Should I Consider Investing? When should I start investing? As soon as you can afford to. Because investment returns compound, that is, the money you earn from investing then earns money, the sooner you begin investing, the more time you give for this process to work. Learn More 5 Advantages of Investing in Your 20s What time does the stock market open and close? In the U.S. stock markets major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and Nasdaq are open from 930 .a.m to 4.p.m Eastern Time. However, this varies around the world depending on what exchange youre looking at and whether that day is a holiday. Learn More Stock Market Opening Times Around the World Key Terms Bond Bond Yield Technical Analysis Sector Breakdown Short-Term Investments Investment Banker Wall Street Bond A bond is an investment representing part or all of a loan to a person, government, or other entity. Bonds are issued at a set par value, usually 1000 or 100, and their prices fluctuates based on interest rates and perceived credit-worthiness of the borrower. Learn More Bond Yield A bonds yield is the investment return that an investor will gain from a bond, usually expressed as a percentage. This is the percent of the bonds price that each set interest payment will be. Yields go up as a bonds price goes down and vice versa because they are a percent of the bonds value, therefore the higher the bonds price, the lower a percentage of that value a set interest payment will be. Learn More Technical Analysis Technical analysis is a form of stock analysis that involves looking at the price movements of stocks over time in order to predict where they will go. It attempts to find patterns in stock movements based on statistical trends such as the moving average of a stock or its trading volume. This contrasts with fundamental analysis which looks at the financial values of the business that issued the stock and economic conditions affecting the market and that business in order to assess where a stocks price will go. Learn More Sector Breakdown A sector breakdown is a way to look at a portfolio by organizing it by which sector of the economy each stock is in. This allows an investor to, depending on their investing strategy, avoid stocks from companies in sectors they dont believe to have strong prospects, focus on stocks from sectors they believe are in a good position for growth, or ensure their portfolio is diversified. Learn More Short-Term Investments Short term investments are investments that are designed to be held for a year or less or investments a company intends to sell within 12 months. They are also known as marketable securities or temporary investments, and can be easily sold for cash. Learn More Investment Banker An investment banker works for a bank that deals mostly with raising capital for large institutions such as governments and corporations. They also deal with corporate restructuring as well as corporate mergers acquisition MA. Learn More Wall Street Wall Street is a street in New York City which, due to having been a historical center of the U.S. financial industry, is used as a term to refer to that industry as a whole. It is often contrasted to Main Street, which is used as a term to represent the broader economy outside the financial industry, especially small businesses. Learn More",

Education 1112 by GonzooTrading 2 Golden Cross vs. Death Cross What Do They Really Tell Us? Hello, traders! Its hard to scroll through a crypto newsfeed without spotting a headline screaming about a Golden Cross forming on Bitcoin or warning of an ominous Death Cross approaching. But what do these classic MA signals can really mean? Are they as prophetic as they sound, or is there more nuance to the story? Lets break it down. The Basics What Are Golden and Death Crosses? At their core, both patterns are simple moving average crossovers. They occur when two moving averages typically the 50-day and the 200-day cross paths on a chart. Golden Cross When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, signaling a potential shift from a bearish phase to a bullish trend. Its often seen as a sign of renewed strength and a long-term uptrend. Death Cross When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA, suggesting a possible transition from bullish to bearish, hinting at extended downside pressure. Why They Work and When They Dont In theory, the idea is simple The 50-day MA represents shorter-term sentiment, while the 200-day MA captures longer-term momentum. When short-term price action overtakes long-term averages, its seen as a bullish signal golden cross. When it drops below, its bearish death cross. This highlights a key point moving average crossover signals are inherently delayed. Theyre based on historical data, so they cant predict future price moves in real time. October 2020 Golden Cross On the weekly BTCUSDT chart, we can clearly see a Golden Cross forming in October 2020. The 50-week MA short-term crossed above the 200-week MA long-term, marking the start of Bitcoins explosive rally from around 11,000 to its then all-time high above 60,000 in 2021. This signal aligned with growing institutional interest and the post-halving narrative, reinforcing the bull case. June 2021 Death Cross Just months after Bitcoins peak, a Death Cross emerged around June 2021, near the 35,000 mark. However, this was more of a lagging signal by the time it appeared, the sharp pullback from 60K had already taken place. Interestingly, the market stabilized not long after, with a recovery above 50K later that year, showing that Death Cross signals arent always the end of the story. Mid-2022 Another Death Cross In mid-2022, BTC formed another Death Cross during its prolonged bear market. This one aligned better with the broader trend, as price continued to slide towards 15,000, reflecting macro pressures like tightening monetary policies and the collapse of major players in the crypto space. Early 2024 Golden Cross Comeback The most recent Golden Cross appeared in early 2024, signaling renewed bullish momentum. This crossover preceded a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin above 100,000 by mid-2025, as seen in your chart. While macro factors like ETF approvals or regulatory clarity also played a role, this MA signal coincided with a notable shift in sentiment. Golden Cross Guaranteed Rally, Death Cross Doom While these MA crossovers are clean and appealing, theyre not foolproof. Their lagging nature means they often confirm trends rather than predict them. For example, in June 2021, the Death Cross appeared after much of the selling pressure had already played out. Conversely, in October 2020 and early 2024, the Golden Crosses aligned with genuine upward shifts. Why Care About These Signals? Because they help us contextualize market sentiment. The golden cross and death cross reflect collective trader psychology optimism and fear. But to truly understand them, we need to combine them with volume, market structure, and macro narratives. So, are golden crosses and death crosses reliable signals, or just eye-catching headlines? Your chart tells us both stories sometimes they work, sometimes they mislead. Whats your take? Do you use these MA signals in your trading, or do you prefer other methods? Lets discuss below!

In practice, you panic-sold at support. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. Yogi Berra Welcome to trading where you read about patience and discipline, and then blow up your account chasing a breakout at 3AM. Lets explore the top 10 ways trading theory gets wrecked by real-world execution, complete with painful honesty and maybe a laugh or two because crying is for after market close. ________________________________________ 1. In theory You always follow your trading plan. In practice You make a new plan after every trade. That loss wasnt part of the plan, so obviously the plan was wrong. Lets fix it during the trade in real-time while it bleeds. Genius. ________________________________________ 2. In theory You manage risk carefully. In practice Let me just move the stop... just this once... just 10 more pips... Before you know it, your stop loss is in the next timezone, and your trade is now a long-term investment. ________________________________________ 3. In theory Backtesting proves the strategy works. I n practice Backtest you, alone, with no emotions, clicking replay in TradingView. Live trading markets screaming, Twitter panicking, and you entering on the 1-minute chart because it felt right. ________________________________________ 4. In theory Youll be objective. In practice You saw one green candle and whispered This is it. The reversal. I feel it. You werent objective. You were in a situationship with your trade. ________________________________________ 5. In theory RR 21 minimum. In practice You close at 0.3R just to be safe and then it hits target 10 minutes later while you re-enter worse, and get stopped. ________________________________________ 6. In theory You wait for confirmation. In practice You anticipate confirmation. You hope for confirmation. Spoiler hope is not a strategy. But hey, at least you learned again. ________________________________________ 7. In theory Youre a rules-based, emotionless trader. In practice You meditate, breathe deeply, journal, and then buy Gold after CPI with no stop loss and max leverage. So much for being the Terminator. ________________________________________ 8. In theory More knowledge better performance. I n practice You read five books, memorized all candlestick names, and still entered long into resistance because it looked bullish. Trading isnt trivia night. Its controlled decision-making under fire. ________________________________________ 9. In theory Youll accept losses calmly. In practice First you rage-quit. Then you revenge trade. Then you open ChatGPT and ask Should I hedge this 80 drawdown? ________________________________________ 10. In theory Youll be consistent. In practice You traded London Open on Monday, Asian Session on Tuesday, and New York close on Friday. Consistency? You dont even use the same time frame twice in a row. ________________________________________ So how do you bridge the gap? 1. Journal your trades honestly. Especially the emotional mess-ups. 2. Create rules you can actually follow not Instagram-quote rules. 3. Simulate real conditions including drawdowns, boredom, and fakeouts. 4. Accept that mistakes are part of the job and build for resilience, not perfection. 5. Trade small enough that you dont care much so you can learn while surviving. ________________________________________ Final word Trading theory is like a clean whiteboard. But the market? Its a chaotic toddler with crayons and no rules. If you can operate inside that chaos with clarity and emotional control thats when the theory starts working.

Education by abhirampajj 0 THE CONCEPT OF SUPPORT BECOMING RESISTANCE In the context of forex trading, the concept of support becoming resistance refers to a phenomenon that occurs when a price level that previously acted as a support level for an assets price now switches roles and becomes a resistance level after it has been broken. Heres a more detailed explanation Support Level In forex trading, a support level is a price level at which a currency pair or any other financial instrument tends to find buying interest. This buying interest is strong enough to halt or reverse a downtrend in the price. Traders believe that the assets price is likely to bounce off this support level and move higher, making it an essential point on the price chart. Resistance Level On the other hand, a resistance level is a price level where selling interest is significant enough to prevent the price from rising further. It acts as a barrier that tends to halt or reverse an uptrend in the price. Traders expect the price to bounce off this resistance level and move lower. Support Becoming Resistance The interesting concept comes into play when the price breaks below a previously established support level. When a support level is breached and the price continues to decline, it signifies a shift in market sentiment. The level that was once a support now becomes a resistance level for the price. If the price attempts to rally back up and reach that previous support level, it often faces selling pressure from traders who missed the initial breakdown and now see it as an opportunity to sell at a better price. As a result, the price might struggle to move beyond that level, and it starts acting as a resistance zone.

Real Examples Your Forex broker could be manipulating your trades right now - and you would not even know it. They can rig your charts, trap you in losing trades and steal your money. In this article, I will expose how they do it, I will show you a real example how brokers manipulations can lead to bad trading decisions and significant losses. What Im about to show you will change the way you trade forever, and youll never look at your trading charts the same way again. The story started with a trading live stream in my academy with my students. We spotted a nice setup to trade. We found a strong 4H support on Silver with a confirmed liquidity grab after its test. As a confirmation, we identified a cup handle pattern on an hourly time frame and a breakout of its neckline with a bullish imbalance. When I got my entry signal, I opened my trading terminal to execute the trade. And the way I trade is very specific I use TradingView for chart analysis BUT I have a separate trading terminal for trade execution. When I opened the same setup in my trading terminal, I saw a completely different picture and a strong bearish signal. The broker that I use for technical chart analysis is OANDA , while my trading terminal uses ICMarkets quotes. On the right is the price chart of SILVER with IC. There we can see a valid breakout and a candle close below the support with its consequent retest. From a price action perspective, it is a strong signal to sell . I got a strong feeling that some kind of manipulation is going on here, so I decided to check Silver charts of other brokers. Only the broker that I used for market analysis on TradingView provided a bullish signal, while other brokers had very bearish charts on Silver. It looked very suspicious and felt like OANDA broker was inducing me to buy, knowing that the price is going to drop. So I made a decision not to take a trade. Look what happened then. After a retest of a broken support, Silver dropped sharply. Checking the same trading setup on different brokers charts can help you to avoid the manipulation. My simple decision to examine more charts helped to avoid a losing trade. I strictly recommend you doing the same thing before you place a trade. IF you see a strong deviation of your charts from other brokers, stay alert and vigilant. Probably it is not a good idea to open the trade. Please, support my work with like, thank you!

Support at 3256.73? Resistance at 3352.14? Really? That precise? This kind of fixed-point trading might look good on a chart, but it doesnt work in a real, volatile market especially not in 2025. Ive been trading Gold as my primary asset for over a decade, and if theres one thing experience and logic have consistently shown me, its this you should trade price zones, not fixed points. Let me explain you why. ________________________________________ 1. Gold Is Not a Low-Volatility Asset Gold isnt EURUSD. It doesnt move in clean 20-30-pip increments. Its volatile, reactive, and sensitive to everything from Fed rate rumors to random tweets and global conflicts. Over the past months, volatility has spiked and not just because of economic data. Were seeing Geopolitical uncertainty that escalates and de-escalates overnight Macro shifts in interest rate expectations almost weekly Market sentiment changing faster than ever In this environment, the idea that price will reverse exactly at 3352.14 is pure fantasy. ________________________________________ 2. Percentages Matter More Than Pips Now Back when Gold was around 2000, a 200-pip move meant a 1 change in price. Now, with Gold trading above 3300, the same 1 move is 330 pips. So, if youre still treating 3050 pips like a serious target on Gold, youre not adjusting to reality. Youre chasing crumbs in a storm. Ive written before about why you shouldnt trade Gold for small 3050 pip moves. Its no longer a high-probability game the math doesnt work. Youre either over-leveraging or underperforming. ________________________________________ 3. Price Zones Are Where the Smart Money Trades Markets arent binary. They dont care about your exact number. They care about liquidity zones where enough buyers and sellers are willing to transact in volume. Heres how professionals approach it Support isnt a number its a range. Resistance isnt a line its a battle zone. When you analyze Gold, think in ranges like 32803290 or 33203330. This is where price breathes, traps traders, and makes real moves. Fixed points create unrealistic expectations and false confidence. ________________________________________ 4. Emotion Kills Precision in Real Time In live trading, youre not a machine. Youre a human reacting to candles, tweets, and news. Waiting for an entry at exactly 3352.14 often means You miss the move entirely Or you force a bad entry when price front-runs your level But when you use zones, you give yourself the flexibility to act within context, not dogma. You can read the candle behavior inside that zone, you can spot exhaustion, you can scale in or out you become tactical, not rigid. ________________________________________ Final Thoughts Adapt or Stay Frustrated If you want to trade Gold successfully in this current market, you must adapt Use zones instead of pin-point levels Adjust your expectations to the new pip-to-percentage dynamics Respect the volatility and macro backdrop The traders who will survive are not the ones with the cleanest lines on their charts. Theyre the ones who know how to handle chaos with structure, using zones as flexible tools, not false certainties. Start thinking in ranges, not numbers. Thats where the edge is.

Education by Mihai_Iacob 1 1 2 7 What Is Naked Forex Trading, and How Do Traders Use It? What Is Naked Forex Trading, and How Do Traders Use It? Traders rely on various tools and techniques to trade the forex market. Naked forex trading is one of the oldest and most popular trading approaches among currency traders. This article delves into the details of naked trading, providing insights into its implementation and distinguishing features that set it apart from other analysis techniques. Understanding Naked Forex Trading Naked trading is a trading style that involves analysing markets using a clean price chart, meaning one without technical indicators. Traders who use this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts. Naked trading has its roots in the early days of trading, long before the advent of sophisticated technical analysis tools and indicators. Early traders relied solely on price action and market behaviour to make trading decisions. By stripping away the complexity of modern trading tools, naked trading aims to return to the fundamental principles of trading, emphasising the importance of understanding market psychology and price dynamics. Core Principles of Naked Forex Trading Naked forex trading is based on the following principles - Price action analysis is the foundation of naked trading, focusing on the examination of asset price movements without the help of technical indicators. Traders rely on bar, line, or Japanese candlestick charts to identify patterns, trends, and key support and resistance levels. By concentrating on real-time price movements, traders aim to make their trading decisions based on how prices behave at specific levels. - Naked trading emphasises simplicity and clarity as it removes the clutter of numerous trading tools. This approach helps traders maintain a clear view of the market, making it potentially easier to identify trading opportunities. The simplification also reduces cognitive load, enabling traders to focus on the most critical market movements. - Trader instinct, often referred to as gut feeling or traders intuition, plays a significant role in naked trading. This instinct is honed over time through experience and the extensive observation of price movements and market behaviour. Key Techniques and Tools Mastering price action analysis is crucial in naked trading. These are the four key tools for those who use naked trading. Candlestick Patterns Candlestick patterns play a crucial role in naked trading strategy by providing visual representations of price movements over a specified period. Traders look for different price formations to analyse potential market reversals, continuations, or indecisions. Common candlestick patterns include doji, engulfing patterns, hammer, shooting star, and spinning top. Each offers insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements. Chart Patterns Chart patterns on price charts indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Traders using naked trading techniques rely on chart patterns like flags, rounding topbottom, diamonds, and rectangles to identify key levels where the price is likely to react. These patterns help traders anticipate market movements and plan entry and exit points accordingly. Support and Resistance Levels Support and resistance levels are fundamental concepts in naked trading, representing levels the price struggled to break above resistance or hold above support. Traders identify these levels on price charts to anticipate potential price reversals or breakouts. Support and resistance levels are crucial for setting profit targets, placing stop-loss orders, and managing risk. Trendlines and Channels Trendlines and channels are used by naked traders to visualise the direction and strength of a trend. Trendlines connect successive higher lows uptrend or lower highs downtrend on a price chart, helping traders identify trend reversals or confirm trend continuations. Channels are formed by drawing parallel lines to connect highs and lows, creating a channel in which the price typically moves. Advantages of Naked Forex Trading Naked trading has many advantages therefore, its still used by traders around the globe. Here are the key benefits of naked forex trading - Enhanced Focus and Simplicity This approach removes market clutter as it offers enhanced focus by eliminating complex technical indicators. Without the distraction of multiple indicators that provide lagging signals, traders may respond more effectively to changes in price movements. - Improved Market Understanding By relying on naked trading tools, traders may better understand market behaviour and psychology. Observing price action directly on charts potentially enhances traders ability to interpret market sentiment, identify key support and resistance levels, and anticipate potential trend reversals or continuations. This hands-on approach fosters a deeper understanding of the nuances of the market and improves trading skills over time. - Flexibility and Adaptability Traders are not constrained by specific indicator signals or rigid trading rules. Instead, they can adjust their approach based on real-time price action and evolving market dynamics. This flexibility allows them to take advantage of emerging opportunities and adapt their strategies to potentially mitigate risks. Challenges and Limitations Although naked trading can be effective, it has limitations that a trader considers before relying on this approach. - Learning Curve As naked forex trading relies heavily on interpreting price action without the assistance of technical indicators, traders may need to dedicate considerable time and effort to mastering candlestick patterns, chart analysis, and understanding market psychology. Developing the skill to interpret price movements accurately demands persistence and consistent practice. - Emotional Discipline A notable challenge of naked trading is the absence of clear buy or sell signals provided by indicators, which can lead to heightened emotional responses to market fluctuations. Traders must maintain discipline by adhering to their trading plans, implementing risk management strategies, and avoiding impulsive decisions. - Market Noise Navigating market noise is another hurdle in naked trading. Market noise refers to random price fluctuations that obscure meaningful price patterns. Traders need the patience and experience to distinguish between significant price movements and temporary fluctuations. Practical Application of Naked Forex Trading Setting up a trading plan is essential for implementing naked forex trading. Traders might use the following rules - Define Your Trading Goals Determine your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and period of trading. - Select Currency Pairs Choose currency pairs that align with your trading strategy and offer sufficient liquidity. - Identify Key Trading Times Determine optimal times to trade based on market volatility and your availability. - Establish Entry and Exit Rules Define criteria for entering trades based on price action signals, such as candlestick patterns or supportresistance levels. Similarly, rules for exiting trades should be established to potentially lock in returns or cut losses. - Risk Management Implement risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and calculating position sizes based on your risk tolerance and account size. - Review and Adapt Regularly review your plan to assess its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments based on evolving market conditions and personal trading performance. Real-Life Examples and Case Studies Real-life examples and case studies illustrate how naked forex trading principles are applied in practice Example 1 Trading Support and Resistance A trader identifies a currency pair approaching a key support level on the daily chart. They wait for a bullish reversal candlestick pattern, such as dragonfly doji, to form near the support level. They enter a long trade with a stop-loss below the support level and a profit target at the next resistance level. Example 2 Trend Confirmation A trader observes a currency pair in a strong downtrend on the hourly chart. They wait for a pullback to a trendline and look for a bearish engulfing pattern to confirm the continuation of the downtrend. They enter a sell trade with a tight stop-loss above the trendline. However, it is difficult to determine the profit target as there are no swing lows nearby. The Bottom Line When they understand the naked trading forex strategy, traders may use it in other markets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, its important to note that any analysis does not guarantee effective trading, and other factors should be considered alongside chart analysis. Risk management and a proper mindset are essential for long-term consistency. FAQs What Is Naked Trading in Forex? Naked, or price action trading, is a forex trading approach that involves analysing the market using a clean price chart without any technical indicators. Traders relying on this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts rather than past performance. The strategy emphasises identifying key support and resistance levels, trend reversals, and price corrections purely through the observation of bar, line, or candlestick charts. Can I Trade Without Chart Patterns? Yes, trading without chart patterns may be possible using alternative methods such as indicator-based strategies, quantitative models, fundamental analysis, or sentiment analysis. These approaches allow traders to analyse the markets based on technical indicators, mathematical algorithms, economic data, or market sentiment. What Is a Chart Pattern in a Price Action Strategy? A chart pattern in a price action strategy refers to the specific formations and shapes created by the price movements of an asset, which traders use to analyse future market behaviour. These patterns emerge due to the collective actions of buyers and sellers and can indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Some common chart patterns include triangles suggesting a consolidation before a breakout, Quasimodo indicating a potential trend reversal, and flags signalling the continuation of an existing trend. What Is the 5-3-1 Trading Strategy? The 5-3-1 trading strategy is a disciplined approach designed to help traders focus and improve their trading skills. It involves trading just five currency pairs to reduce complexity and enhance expertise in those markets. Traders then use only three specific strategies to master and consistently apply. Finally, they select one trading timeframe to maintain consistency and avoid confusion. Important At FXOpen UK, Cryptocurrency trading via CFDs is only available to our Professional clients.

Support and resistance levels show where price has reacted strongly in the past. These are zones where many traders including large players have placed buy or sell orders. Support where buyers step in and push price up Resistance where sellers step in and push price down These levels are important because they act like decision zones - Price might bounce from these levels - Or break through and start a new move - Or even fake out traders before reversing again Knowing where these levels are gives you an edge - You can better time your entries and exits - You avoid chasing price in the middle of nowhere - You prepare for market reactions not random guesses Think of them like traffic lights for the market when price hits them, something important usually happens. 2 Three Main Types of Support and Resistance There are 3 key types of support and resistance levels traders commonly use - Level-Based Horizontal zones drawn from key highs and lows - Pattern-Based Supportresistance found in chart patterns like triangles, flags, etc. - Channel-Based Diagonal trendlines showing support and resistance in a channel Today, we focus on level-based support and resistance horizontal lines drawn on key price zones. 3 How to Draw Support and Resistance Levels Use daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes to find major zones. These higher timeframes give you stronger, more respected levels. Look for - Candle bodies that close and open around the same price - Strong wicks rejecting a certain level - Zones where price has bounced multiple times in the past I often pick - The close of a red candle - The open of the next green candle These spots usually show where sellers lost control and buyers stepped in or vice versa. 4 Timeframes and Their Strength The higher the timeframe, the stronger the level - Monthly very strong, long-term zones - Weekly strong and reliable - Daily useful for swing trading - Lower timeframes 15m, 5m more noise, less reliable unless youre day trading or scalping Pick levels based on your strategy - Swing traders use dailyweeklymonthly - Scalpers lower timeframes with extra confluence volume, structure 5 Dont Use SupportResistance Alone Support and resistance are helpful but not enough by themselves. Always combine them with - Market structure higher highslows - Volume confirmation - Indicators or price action signals You want to watch how price reacts at your levels. Wait for confirmation before making decisions. 6 Common Mistakes Traders Make Mistake 1 Drawing too many levels clutters your chart and creates confusion. Mistake 2 Keeping old levels that have already been broken or invalidated. Mistake 3 Ignoring volume. Just because price hits a level doesnt mean it will reverse. You need volume to back the move. Also Dont enter blindly on breakout, breakouts can fail. Wait for confirmation. Dont assume a level is strong just because its touched once look for multiple rejections. 7 Example How I Draw SupportResistance Lets say Im looking at a daily chart. - I find a red candle that closes at 42,000 - Then a green candle opens at 42,000 and pushes higher That tells me buyers stepped in at 42,000 this is a potential support. I draw my horizontal line across that level. Then I zoom into 30m or 15m charts to watch price behavior when it comes back to that level. If price respects it again, I may enter a trade based on the reaction. This technique gives me more confidence and clarity. I know where liquidity might be waiting. I can combine it with indicators or volume tools. I avoid random trades. Summary Identify a timeframe Use the monthly, weekly, or daily chart. Look for two candles Draw your support or resistance line at the point where one candle closes and the next one opens. Make sure the level hasnt been hit yet This helps you spot areas where liquidity grabs might happen. Wait for price to reach the level Once price touches the support or resistance zone, watch how it reacts. After price touches the level, remove it Once tested, that level is no longer fresh and should be cleared from your chart. Support and resistance isnt magic but used with confluence, it becomes a powerful guide. Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE and COMMENT if you enjoy this idea!

Education by Risk_Adj_Return 0 Mastering the ICT Power of 3 concept - How to use it in trading! The financial markets often appear chaotic and unpredictable, but behind the scenes, institutional players operate with clear strategies that shape price action. One such strategy is the ICT Inner Circle Trader Power of 3 model, a framework used to understand and anticipate market cycles through three key phases accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. This guide will break down each of these phases in detail, explaining how smart money operates and how retail traders can align themselves with the true direction of the market. What will be discussed? - The 3 phases - Examples of the PO3 - How to trade the PO3 - Tips for trading the PO3 The 3 phases Accumulation The Accumulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model refers to the initial stage of a market cycle where institutional or smart money participants quietly build their positions. During this time, price typically moves sideways within a tight range, often showing little to no clear direction. This is intentional. The market appears quiet or indecisive, which is designed to confuse retail traders and keep them out of alignment with the real intentions of the markets larger players. In this phase, smart money is not looking to move the market dramatically. Instead, they are focused on accumulating long or short positions without drawing attention. They do this by keeping price contained within a consolidation zone. The idea is to gather enough liquidity, often from unsuspecting retail traders entering early breakout trades or trying to trade the range, before making a more aggressive move. Manipulation The Manipulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the second stage that follows accumulation. This phase is where smart money deliberately moves the market in the opposite direction of their intended move to trigger retail stop losses, induce emotional decisions, and create liquidity. After price has consolidated during accumulation, many retail traders are either already positioned or have orders waiting just outside the range, either stop losses from those trading the range or breakout orders from those anticipating a directional move. The manipulation phase exploits this positioning. Price will often break out of the accumulation range in one direction, appearing to confirm a new trend. This move is designed to look convincing, it might even come with a spike in volume or momentum to draw traders in. However, this breakout is a false move. It doesnt represent the true intention of smart money. Instead, its meant to sweep liquidity, triggering stop losses above or below the range, and then reverse sharply. This stop run provides the liquidity needed for large players to finalize their positions at optimal prices. Once enough liquidity is collected, and retail traders are caught offside, the real move begins. Distribution The Distribution Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the final stage of the cycle, following accumulation and manipulation. This is where the true intention of smart money is revealed, and the market makes a sustained, directional move, either bullish or bearish. Unlike the earlier phases, distribution is marked by clear price expansion, increased volatility, and decisive momentum. After smart money has accumulated positions and shaken out retail traders through manipulation, they have the liquidity and positioning needed to drive the market in their desired direction. The distribution phase is where these positions are distributed into the broader market, meaning, institutions begin to offload their positions into the retail flow that is now chasing the move. Retail traders, seeing the strong trend, often jump in late, providing the liquidity for smart money to exit profitably. This phase is typically what retail traders perceive as the real trend, and in a sense, it is. However, by the time the trend is obvious, smart money has already entered during accumulation and profited from the manipulation. What appears to be a breakout or trend continuation to most retail participants is actually the final leg of the smart moneys strategy. They are now unloading their positions while price continues to expand. Examples of the Power of 3 How to trade the PO3? Start by identifying a clear accumulation range. This typically happens during the Asian session or the early part of the London session. Price moves sideways, forming a consolidation zone. Your job here isnt to trade, but to observe. Draw horizontal lines marking the high and low of the range. These become your key liquidity zones. Next, anticipate the manipulation phase, which usually occurs during the London session or at the NY open. Price will often break out of the range, triggering stop losses above the high or below the low of the accumulation zone. This move is deceptive, it is not the real trend. Do not chase it. Instead, wait for signs of rejection, such as a sharp reversal after the liquidity grab, imbalance filling, or a shift in market structure on a lower timeframe like a 1- or 5-minute chart. Once manipulation has swept liquidity and price starts showing signs of reversing back inside the range or beyond, you now look for a confirmation of the true move, this begins the distribution phase. You enter in the direction opposite of the manipulation move, ideally once price breaks a structure level confirming that smart money has taken control. For example, if price consolidates overnight, fakes a move to the downside running sell stops, and then quickly reverses and breaks above a key swing high, thats your signal that the true move is likely up. Enter after the break and retest of structure, using a tight stop loss below the recent low. Your target should be based on liquidity pools, fair value gaps, or higher-timeframe imbalances. The key to trading the Power of 3 is patience and precision. Youre not trying to catch every move, but to wait for the market to complete its cycle of deception and then ride the clean expansion. Ideally, your entry comes just after manipulation, and you hold through the distributionexpansion phase, taking partials at key liquidity levels along the way. Tips for trading the PO3 1. Learn price movements Before you can effectively apply the ICT Power of 3 strategy, its crucial to have a deep understanding of how price behaves. This means being comfortable identifying market structure, recognizing trend direction, and interpreting candlestick dynamics. Since the Power of 3 is deeply rooted in how price moves in real time, a strong grasp of these basics will give you the confidence to read the market correctly as each phase develops. 2. Analyse multiple timeframes Although the Power of 3 pattern shows up on lower timeframes, relying on just one can lead to misreads. Youll gain a clearer picture when you align the short-term view with higher timeframe structure. For example, what appears to be accumulation on the 15-minute chart may simply be a retracement in a larger trend on the 1-hour or daily. By examining multiple timeframes together, you can better identify the true setup and avoid being tricked by noise. 3. Exercise patience A key part of trading the Power of 3 is knowing when to act, and more importantly, when not to. Its easy to get impatient during the accumulation or manipulation phases, but entering too early often leads to frustration or losses. True discipline comes from waiting for the expansion or distribution phase, when the market reveals its real direction. This is where the most favorable risk-to-reward setups occur.

Gold Forex Trading Basics If you just started trading, you are probably wondering how to choose a trading time frame. In the todays post, I will go through the common time frames, and explain when to apply them. 1m 5m, 15m Time Frames These 4 t.fs are very rapid and are primarily applied by scalpers . If your goal is to catch quick ebbs and flows within a trading session, that is a perfect selection for you. 30m, 1H Time Frame These 2 are perfectly suited for day traders. Executing the analysis and opening the trades on these time frames, you will be able to catch the moves within a trading day. 4h, Daily Time Frames These time frames are relatively slow . They are mostly applied by swing traders, who aim to trade the moves that last from several days to several weeks. Weekly, Monthly Time Frames These time frames reveal long-term historical perspective and are mostly used by investors and position traders. If your goal is to look for buy hold assets, these time frames will help you to make a reasonable decision. When you are choosing a time frame to trade, consider the following factors 1 - Time Availability How much time dailyweekly are you able to sacrifice on trading? Remember a simple rule lower is the time frame, more time it requires for management. 2 - Risk Tolerance Smaller time frames usually involve higher risk, while longer-term time frames are considered to be more conservative and stable. 3 - Your Trading Goals If you are planning to benefit from short term price fluctuations you should concentrate your attention on lower time frames, while investing and long-term capital accumulation suite for higher time frames. Time frame selection is nuanced and a complex topic. However, I believe that these simple rules and factors will help you to correctly choose the one for you.

Education 1112 by GonzooTrading 2 Golden Cross vs. Death Cross What Do They Really Tell Us? Hello, traders! Its hard to scroll through a crypto newsfeed without spotting a headline screaming about a Golden Cross forming on Bitcoin or warning of an ominous Death Cross approaching. But what do these classic MA signals can really mean? Are they as prophetic as they sound, or is there more nuance to the story? Lets break it down. The Basics What Are Golden and Death Crosses? At their core, both patterns are simple moving average crossovers. They occur when two moving averages typically the 50-day and the 200-day cross paths on a chart. Golden Cross When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, signaling a potential shift from a bearish phase to a bullish trend. Its often seen as a sign of renewed strength and a long-term uptrend. Death Cross When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA, suggesting a possible transition from bullish to bearish, hinting at extended downside pressure. Why They Work and When They Dont In theory, the idea is simple The 50-day MA represents shorter-term sentiment, while the 200-day MA captures longer-term momentum. When short-term price action overtakes long-term averages, its seen as a bullish signal golden cross. When it drops below, its bearish death cross. This highlights a key point moving average crossover signals are inherently delayed. Theyre based on historical data, so they cant predict future price moves in real time. October 2020 Golden Cross On the weekly BTCUSDT chart, we can clearly see a Golden Cross forming in October 2020. The 50-week MA short-term crossed above the 200-week MA long-term, marking the start of Bitcoins explosive rally from around 11,000 to its then all-time high above 60,000 in 2021. This signal aligned with growing institutional interest and the post-halving narrative, reinforcing the bull case. June 2021 Death Cross Just months after Bitcoins peak, a Death Cross emerged around June 2021, near the 35,000 mark. However, this was more of a lagging signal by the time it appeared, the sharp pullback from 60K had already taken place. Interestingly, the market stabilized not long after, with a recovery above 50K later that year, showing that Death Cross signals arent always the end of the story. Mid-2022 Another Death Cross In mid-2022, BTC formed another Death Cross during its prolonged bear market. This one aligned better with the broader trend, as price continued to slide towards 15,000, reflecting macro pressures like tightening monetary policies and the collapse of major players in the crypto space. Early 2024 Golden Cross Comeback The most recent Golden Cross appeared in early 2024, signaling renewed bullish momentum. This crossover preceded a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin above 100,000 by mid-2025, as seen in your chart. While macro factors like ETF approvals or regulatory clarity also played a role, this MA signal coincided with a notable shift in sentiment. Golden Cross Guaranteed Rally, Death Cross Doom While these MA crossovers are clean and appealing, theyre not foolproof. Their lagging nature means they often confirm trends rather than predict them. For example, in June 2021, the Death Cross appeared after much of the selling pressure had already played out. Conversely, in October 2020 and early 2024, the Golden Crosses aligned with genuine upward shifts. Why Care About These Signals? Because they help us contextualize market sentiment.

In practice, you panic-sold at support. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. Yogi Berra Welcome to trading where you read about patience and discipline, and then blow up your account chasing a breakout at 3AM. Lets explore the top 10 ways trading theory gets wrecked by real-world execution, complete with painful honesty and maybe a laugh or two because crying is for after market close. ________________________________________ 1. In theory You always follow your trading plan. In practice You make a new plan after every trade. That loss wasnt part of the plan, so obviously the plan was wrong. Lets fix it during the trade in real-time while it bleeds. Genius. ________________________________________ 2. In theory You manage risk carefully. In practice Let me just move the stop... just this once... just 10 more pips... Before you know it, your stop loss is in the next timezone, and your trade is now a long-term investment. ________________________________________ 3. In theory Backtesting proves the strategy works. I n practice Backtest you, alone, with no emotions, clicking replay in TradingView. Live trading markets screaming, Twitter panicking, and you entering on the 1-minute chart because it felt right. ________________________________________ 4. In theory Youll be objective. In practice You saw one green candle and whispered This is it. The reversal. I feel it. You werent objective. You were in a situationship with your trade. ________________________________________ 5. In theory RR 21 minimum. In practice You close at 0.3R just to be safe and then it hits target 10 minutes later while you re-enter worse, and get stopped. ________________________________________ 6. In theory You wait for confirmation. In practice You anticipate confirmation. You hope for confirmation. Spoiler hope is not a strategy. But hey, at least you learned again. ________________________________________ 7. In theory Youre a rules-based, emotionless trader. In practice You meditate, breathe deeply, journal, and then buy Gold after CPI with no stop loss and max leverage. So much for being the Terminator. ________________________________________ 8. In theory More knowledge better performance. I n practice You read five books, memorized all candlestick names, and still entered long into resistance because it looked bullish. Trading isnt trivia night. Its controlled decision-making under fire. ________________________________________ 9. In theory Youll accept losses calmly. In practice First you rage-quit. Then you revenge trade. Then you open ChatGPT and ask Should I hedge this 80 drawdown? ________________________________________ 10. In theory Youll be consistent. In practice You traded London Open on Monday, Asian Session on Tuesday, and New York close on Friday. Consistency? You dont even use the same time frame twice in a row. ________________________________________ So how do you bridge the gap? 1. Journal your trades honestly. Especially the emotional mess-ups. 2. Create rules you can actually follow not Instagram-quote rules. 3. Simulate real conditions including drawdowns, boredom, and fakeouts. 4. Accept that mistakes are part of the job and build for resilience, not perfection. 5. Trade small enough that you dont care much so you can learn while surviving. ________________________________________ Final word Trading theory is like a clean whiteboard. But the market? Its a chaotic toddler with crayons and no rules. If you can operate inside that chaos with clarity and emotional control thats when the theory starts working.

Education by abhirampajj 0 THE CONCEPT OF SUPPORT BECOMING RESISTANCE In the context of forex trading, the concept of support becoming resistance refers to a phenomenon that occurs when a price level that previously acted as a support level for an assets price now switches roles and becomes a resistance level after it has been broken. Heres a more detailed explanation Support Level In forex trading, a support level is a price level at which a currency pair or any other financial instrument tends to find buying interest. This buying interest is strong enough to halt or reverse a downtrend in the price. Traders believe that the assets price is likely to bounce off this support level and move higher, making it an essential point on the price chart. Resistance Level On the other hand, a resistance level is a price level where selling interest is significant enough to prevent the price from rising further. It acts as a barrier that tends to halt or reverse an uptrend in the price. Traders expect the price to bounce off this resistance level and move lower. Support Becoming Resistance The interesting concept comes into play when the price breaks below a previously established support level. When a support level is breached and the price continues to decline, it signifies a shift in market sentiment. The level that was once a support now becomes a resistance level for the price. If the price attempts to rally back up and reach that previous support level, it often faces selling pressure from traders who missed the initial breakdown and now see it as an opportunity to sell at a better price. As a result, the price might struggle to move beyond that level, and it starts acting as a resistance zone.

Real Examples Your Forex broker could be manipulating your trades right now - and you would not even know it. They can rig your charts, trap you in losing trades and steal your money. In this article, I will expose how they do it, I will show you a real example how brokers manipulations can lead to bad trading decisions and significant losses. What Im about to show you will change the way you trade forever, and youll never look at your trading charts the same way again. The story started with a trading live stream in my academy with my students. We spotted a nice setup to trade. We found a strong 4H support on Silver with a confirmed liquidity grab after its test. As a confirmation, we identified a cup handle pattern on an hourly time frame and a breakout of its neckline with a bullish imbalance. When I got my entry signal, I opened my trading terminal to execute the trade. And the way I trade is very specific I use TradingView for chart analysis BUT I have a separate trading terminal for trade execution. When I opened the same setup in my trading terminal, I saw a completely different picture and a strong bearish signal. The broker that I use for technical chart analysis is OANDA , while my trading terminal uses ICMarkets quotes. On the right is the price chart of SILVER with IC. There we can see a valid breakout and a candle close below the support with its consequent retest. From a price action perspective, it is a strong signal to sell . I got a strong feeling that some kind of manipulation is going on here, so I decided to check Silver charts of other brokers. Only the broker that I used for market analysis on TradingView provided a bullish signal, while other brokers had very bearish charts on Silver. It looked very suspicious and felt like OANDA broker was inducing me to buy, knowing that the price is going to drop. So I made a decision not to take a trade. Look what happened then. After a retest of a broken support, Silver dropped sharply. Checking the same trading setup on different brokers charts can help you to avoid the manipulation. My simple decision to examine more charts helped to avoid a losing trade. I strictly recommend you doing the same thing before you place a trade. IF you see a strong deviation of your charts from other brokers, stay alert and vigilant. Probably it is not a good idea to open the trade. Please, support my work with like, thank you!

Support at 3256.73? Resistance at 3352.14? Really? That precise? This kind of fixed-point trading might look good on a chart, but it doesnt work in a real, volatile market especially not in 2025. Ive been trading Gold as my primary asset for over a decade, and if theres one thing experience and logic have consistently shown me, its this you should trade price zones, not fixed points. Let me explain you why. ________________________________________ 1. Gold Is Not a Low-Volatility Asset Gold isnt EURUSD. It doesnt move in clean 20-30-pip increments. Its volatile, reactive, and sensitive to everything from Fed rate rumors to random tweets and global conflicts. Over the past months, volatility has spiked and not just because of economic data. Were seeing Geopolitical uncertainty that escalates and de-escalates overnight Macro shifts in interest rate expectations almost weekly Market sentiment changing faster than ever In this environment, the idea that price will reverse exactly at 3352.14 is pure fantasy. ________________________________________ 2. Percentages Matter More Than Pips Now Back when Gold was around 2000, a 200-pip move meant a 1 change in price. Now, with Gold trading above 3300, the same 1 move is 330 pips. So, if youre still treating 3050 pips like a serious target on Gold, youre not adjusting to reality. Youre chasing crumbs in a storm. Ive written before about why you shouldnt trade Gold for small 3050 pip moves. Its no longer a high-probability game the math doesnt work. Youre either over-leveraging or underperforming. ________________________________________ 3. Price Zones Are Where the Smart Money Trades Markets arent binary. They dont care about your exact number. They care about liquidity zones where enough buyers and sellers are willing to transact in volume. Heres how professionals approach it Support isnt a number its a range. Resistance isnt a line its a battle zone. When you analyze Gold, think in ranges like 32803290 or 33203330. This is where price breathes, traps traders, and makes real moves. Fixed points create unrealistic expectations and false confidence. ________________________________________ 4. Emotion Kills Precision in Real Time In live trading, youre not a machine. Youre a human reacting to candles, tweets, and news. Waiting for an entry at exactly 3352.14 often means You miss the move entirely Or you force a bad entry when price front-runs your level But when you use zones, you give yourself the flexibility to act within context, not dogma. You can read the candle behavior inside that zone, you can spot exhaustion, you can scale in or out you become tactical, not rigid. ________________________________________ Final Thoughts Adapt or Stay Frustrated If you want to trade Gold successfully in this current market, you must adapt Use zones instead of pin-point levels Adjust your expectations to the new pip-to-percentage dynamics Respect the volatility and macro backdrop The traders who will survive are not the ones with the cleanest lines on their charts. Theyre the ones who know how to handle chaos with structure, using zones as flexible tools, not false certainties. Start thinking in ranges, not numbers. Thats where the edge is.

Traders rely on various tools and techniques to trade the forex market. Naked forex trading is one of the oldest and most popular trading approaches among currency traders. This article delves into the details of naked trading, providing insights into its implementation and distinguishing features that set it apart from other analysis techniques. Understanding Naked Forex Trading Naked trading is a trading style that involves analysing markets using a clean price chart, meaning one without technical indicators. Traders who use this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts. Naked trading has its roots in the early days of trading, long before the advent of sophisticated technical analysis tools and indicators. Early traders relied solely on price action and market behaviour to make trading decisions. By stripping away the complexity of modern trading tools, naked trading aims to return to the fundamental principles of trading, emphasising the importance of understanding market psychology and price dynamics. Core Principles of Naked Forex Trading Naked forex trading is based on the following principles - Price action analysis is the foundation of naked trading, focusing on the examination of asset price movements without the help of technical indicators. Traders rely on bar, line, or Japanese candlestick charts to identify patterns, trends, and key support and resistance levels. By concentrating on real-time price movements, traders aim to make their trading decisions based on how prices behave at specific levels. - Naked trading emphasises simplicity and clarity as it removes the clutter of numerous trading tools. This approach helps traders maintain a clear view of the market, making it potentially easier to identify trading opportunities. The simplification also reduces cognitive load, enabling traders to focus on the most critical market movements. - Trader instinct, often referred to as gut feeling or traders intuition, plays a significant role in naked trading. This instinct is honed over time through experience and the extensive observation of price movements and market behaviour. Key Techniques and Tools Mastering price action analysis is crucial in naked trading. These are the four key tools for those who use naked trading. Candlestick Patterns Candlestick patterns play a crucial role in naked trading strategy by providing visual representations of price movements over a specified period. Traders look for different price formations to analyse potential market reversals, continuations, or indecisions. Common candlestick patterns include doji, engulfing patterns, hammer, shooting star, and spinning top. Each offers insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements. Chart Patterns Chart patterns on price charts indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Traders using naked trading techniques rely on chart patterns like flags, rounding topbottom, diamonds, and rectangles to identify key levels where the price is likely to react. These patterns help traders anticipate market movements and plan entry and exit points accordingly. Support and Resistance Levels Support and resistance levels are fundamental concepts in naked trading, representing levels the price struggled to break above resistance or hold above support. Traders identify these levels on price charts to anticipate potential price reversals or breakouts. Support and resistance levels are crucial for setting profit targets, placing stop-loss orders, and managing risk. Trendlines and Channels Trendlines and channels are used by naked traders to visualise the direction and strength of a trend. Trendlines connect successive higher lows uptrend or lower highs downtrend on a price chart, helping traders identify trend reversals or confirm trend continuations. Channels are formed by drawing parallel lines to connect highs and lows, creating a channel in which the price typically moves. Advantages of Naked Forex Trading Naked trading has many advantages therefore, its still used by traders around the globe. Here are the key benefits of naked forex trading - Enhanced Focus and Simplicity This approach removes market clutter as it offers enhanced focus by eliminating complex technical indicators. Without the distraction of multiple indicators that provide lagging signals, traders may respond more effectively to changes in price movements. - Improved Market Understanding By relying on naked trading tools, traders may better understand market behaviour and psychology. Observing price action directly on charts potentially enhances traders ability to interpret market sentiment, identify key support and resistance levels, and anticipate potential trend reversals or continuations. This hands-on approach fosters a deeper understanding of the nuances of the market and improves trading skills over time. - Flexibility and Adaptability Traders are not constrained by specific indicator signals or rigid trading rules. Instead, they can adjust their approach based on real-time price action and evolving market dynamics. This flexibility allows them to take advantage of emerging opportunities and adapt their strategies to potentially mitigate risks. Challenges and Limitations Although naked trading can be effective, it has limitations that a trader considers before relying on this approach. - Learning Curve As naked forex trading relies heavily on interpreting price action without the assistance of technical indicators, traders may need to dedicate considerable time and effort to mastering candlestick patterns, chart analysis, and understanding market psychology. Developing the skill to interpret price movements accurately demands persistence and consistent practice. - Emotional Discipline A notable challenge of naked trading is the absence of clear buy or sell signals provided by indicators, which can lead to heightened emotional responses to market fluctuations. Traders must maintain discipline by adhering to their trading plans, implementing risk management strategies, and avoiding impulsive decisions. - Market Noise Navigating market noise is another hurdle in naked trading. Market noise refers to random price fluctuations that obscure meaningful price patterns. Traders need the patience and experience to distinguish between significant price movements and temporary fluctuations. Practical Application of Naked Forex Trading Setting up a trading plan is essential for implementing naked forex trading. Traders might use the following rules - Define Your Trading Goals Determine your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and period of trading. - Select Currency Pairs Choose currency pairs that align with your trading strategy and offer sufficient liquidity. - Identify Key Trading Times Determine optimal times to trade based on market volatility and your availability. - Establish Entry and Exit Rules Define criteria for entering trades based on price action signals, such as candlestick patterns or supportresistance levels. Similarly, rules for exiting trades should be established to potentially lock in returns or cut losses. - Risk Management Implement risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and calculating position sizes based on your risk tolerance and account size. - Review and Adapt Regularly review your plan to assess its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments based on evolving market conditions and personal trading performance. Real-Life Examples and Case Studies Real-life examples and case studies illustrate how naked forex trading principles are applied in practice Example 1 Trading Support and Resistance A trader identifies a currency pair approaching a key support level on the daily chart. They wait for a bullish reversal candlestick pattern, such as dragonfly doji, to form near the support level. They enter a long trade with a stop-loss below the support level and a profit target at the next resistance level. Example 2 Trend Confirmation A trader observes a currency pair in a strong downtrend on the hourly chart. They wait for a pullback to a trendline and look for a bearish engulfing pattern to confirm the continuation of the downtrend. They enter a sell trade with a tight stop-loss above the trendline. However, it is difficult to determine the profit target as there are no swing lows nearby. The Bottom Line When they understand the naked trading forex strategy, traders may use it in other markets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, its important to note that any analysis does not guarantee effective trading, and other factors should be considered alongside chart analysis. Risk management and a proper mindset are essential for long-term consistency. FAQs What Is Naked Trading in Forex? Naked, or price action trading, is a forex trading approach that involves analysing the market using a clean price chart without any technical indicators. Traders relying on this method make decisions based on real-time price movements and their trading instincts rather than past performance. The strategy emphasises identifying key support and resistance levels, trend reversals, and price corrections purely through the observation of bar, line, or candlestick charts. Can I Trade Without Chart Patterns? Yes, trading without chart patterns may be possible using alternative methods such as indicator-based strategies, quantitative models, fundamental analysis, or sentiment analysis. These approaches allow traders to analyse the markets based on technical indicators, mathematical algorithms, economic data, or market sentiment. What Is a Chart Pattern in a Price Action Strategy? A chart pattern in a price action strategy refers to the specific formations and shapes created by the price movements of an asset, which traders use to analyse future market behaviour. These patterns emerge due to the collective actions of buyers and sellers and can indicate potential trend reversals or continuations. Some common chart patterns include triangles suggesting a consolidation before a breakout, Quasimodo indicating a potential trend reversal, and flags signalling the continuation of an existing trend. What Is the 5-3-1 Trading Strategy? The 5-3-1 trading strategy is a disciplined approach designed to help traders focus and improve their trading skills. It involves trading just five currency pairs to reduce complexity and enhance expertise in those markets. Traders then use only three specific strategies to master and consistently apply. Finally, they select one trading timeframe to maintain consistency and avoid confusion. Important At FXOpen UK, Cryptocurrency trading via CFDs is only available to our Professional clients.

Support and resistance levels show where price has reacted strongly in the past. These are zones where many traders including large players have placed buy or sell orders. Support where buyers step in and push price up Resistance where sellers step in and push price down These levels are important because they act like decision zones - Price might bounce from these levels - Or break through and start a new move - Or even fake out traders before reversing again Knowing where these levels are gives you an edge - You can better time your entries and exits - You avoid chasing price in the middle of nowhere - You prepare for market reactions not random guesses Think of them like traffic lights for the market when price hits them, something important usually happens. 2 Three Main Types of Support and Resistance There are 3 key types of support and resistance levels traders commonly use - Level-Based Horizontal zones drawn from key highs and lows - Pattern-Based Supportresistance found in chart patterns like triangles, flags, etc. - Channel-Based Diagonal trendlines showing support and resistance in a channel Today, we focus on level-based support and resistance horizontal lines drawn on key price zones. 3 How to Draw Support and Resistance Levels Use daily, weekly, or monthly timeframes to find major zones. These higher timeframes give you stronger, more respected levels. Look for - Candle bodies that close and open around the same price - Strong wicks rejecting a certain level - Zones where price has bounced multiple times in the past I often pick - The close of a red candle - The open of the next green candle These spots usually show where sellers lost control and buyers stepped in or vice versa. 4 Timeframes and Their Strength The higher the timeframe, the stronger the level - Monthly very strong, long-term zones - Weekly strong and reliable - Daily useful for swing trading - Lower timeframes 15m, 5m more noise, less reliable unless youre day trading or scalping Pick levels based on your strategy - Swing traders use dailyweeklymonthly - Scalpers lower timeframes with extra confluence volume, structure 5 Dont Use SupportResistance Alone Support and resistance are helpful but not enough by themselves. Always combine them with - Market structure higher highslows - Volume confirmation - Indicators or price action signals You want to watch how price reacts at your levels. Wait for confirmation before making decisions. 6 Common Mistakes Traders Make Mistake 1 Drawing too many levels clutters your chart and creates confusion. Mistake 2 Keeping old levels that have already been broken or invalidated. Mistake 3 Ignoring volume. Just because price hits a level doesnt mean it will reverse. You need volume to back the move. Also Dont enter blindly on breakout, breakouts can fail. Wait for confirmation. Dont assume a level is strong just because its touched once look for multiple rejections. 7 Example How I Draw SupportResistance Lets say Im looking at a daily chart. - I find a red candle that closes at 42,000 - Then a green candle opens at 42,000 and pushes higher That tells me buyers stepped in at 42,000 this is a potential support. I draw my horizontal line across that level. Then I zoom into 30m or 15m charts to watch price behavior when it comes back to that level. If price respects it again, I may enter a trade based on the reaction. This technique gives me more confidence and clarity. I know where liquidity might be waiting. I can combine it with indicators or volume tools. I avoid random trades. Summary Identify a timeframe Use the monthly, weekly, or daily chart. Look for two candles Draw your support or resistance line at the point where one candle closes and the next one opens. Make sure the level hasnt been hit yet This helps you spot areas where liquidity grabs might happen. Wait for price to reach the level Once price touches the support or resistance zone, watch how it reacts. After price touches the level, remove it Once tested, that level is no longer fresh and should be cleared from your chart. Support and resistance isnt magic but used with confluence, it becomes a powerful guide. Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE and COMMENT if you enjoy this idea!

Education by Risk_Adj_Return 0 Mastering the ICT Power of 3 concept - How to use it in trading! The financial markets often appear chaotic and unpredictable, but behind the scenes, institutional players operate with clear strategies that shape price action. One such strategy is the ICT Inner Circle Trader Power of 3 model, a framework used to understand and anticipate market cycles through three key phases accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. This guide will break down each of these phases in detail, explaining how smart money operates and how retail traders can align themselves with the true direction of the market. What will be discussed? - The 3 phases - Examples of the PO3 - How to trade the PO3 - Tips for trading the PO3 The 3 phases Accumulation The Accumulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model refers to the initial stage of a market cycle where institutional or smart money participants quietly build their positions. During this time, price typically moves sideways within a tight range, often showing little to no clear direction. This is intentional. The market appears quiet or indecisive, which is designed to confuse retail traders and keep them out of alignment with the real intentions of the markets larger players. In this phase, smart money is not looking to move the market dramatically. Instead, they are focused on accumulating long or short positions without drawing attention. They do this by keeping price contained within a consolidation zone. The idea is to gather enough liquidity, often from unsuspecting retail traders entering early breakout trades or trying to trade the range, before making a more aggressive move. Manipulation The Manipulation Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the second stage that follows accumulation. This phase is where smart money deliberately moves the market in the opposite direction of their intended move to trigger retail stop losses, induce emotional decisions, and create liquidity. After price has consolidated during accumulation, many retail traders are either already positioned or have orders waiting just outside the range, either stop losses from those trading the range or breakout orders from those anticipating a directional move. The manipulation phase exploits this positioning. Price will often break out of the accumulation range in one direction, appearing to confirm a new trend. This move is designed to look convincing, it might even come with a spike in volume or momentum to draw traders in. However, this breakout is a false move. It doesnt represent the true intention of smart money. Instead, its meant to sweep liquidity, triggering stop losses above or below the range, and then reverse sharply. This stop run provides the liquidity needed for large players to finalize their positions at optimal prices. Once enough liquidity is collected, and retail traders are caught offside, the real move begins. Distribution The Distribution Phase in the ICT Power of 3 model is the final stage of the cycle, following accumulation and manipulation. This is where the true intention of smart money is revealed, and the market makes a sustained, directional move, either bullish or bearish. Unlike the earlier phases, distribution is marked by clear price expansion, increased volatility, and decisive momentum. After smart money has accumulated positions and shaken out retail traders through manipulation, they have the liquidity and positioning needed to drive the market in their desired direction. The distribution phase is where these positions are distributed into the broader market, meaning, institutions begin to offload their positions into the retail flow that is now chasing the move. Retail traders, seeing the strong trend, often jump in late, providing the liquidity for smart money to exit profitably. This phase is typically what retail traders perceive as the real trend, and in a sense, it is. However, by the time the trend is obvious, smart money has already entered during accumulation and profited from the manipulation. What appears to be a breakout or trend continuation to most retail participants is actually the final leg of the smart moneys strategy. They are now unloading their positions while price continues to expand. Examples of the Power of 3 How to trade the PO3? Start by identifying a clear accumulation range. This typically happens during the Asian session or the early part of the London session. Price moves sideways, forming a consolidation zone. Your job here isnt to trade, but to observe. Draw horizontal lines marking the high and low of the range. These become your key liquidity zones. Next, anticipate the manipulation phase, which usually occurs during the London session or at the NY open. Price will often break out of the range, triggering stop losses above the high or below the low of the accumulation zone. This move is deceptive, it is not the real trend. Do not chase it. Instead, wait for signs of rejection, such as a sharp reversal after the liquidity grab, imbalance filling, or a shift in market structure on a lower timeframe like a 1- or 5-minute chart. Once manipulation has swept liquidity and price starts showing signs of reversing back inside the range or beyond, you now look for a confirmation of the true move, this begins the distribution phase. You enter in the direction opposite of the manipulation move, ideally once price breaks a structure level confirming that smart money has taken control. For example, if price consolidates overnight, fakes a move to the downside running sell stops, and then quickly reverses and breaks above a key swing high, thats your signal that the true move is likely up. Enter after the break and retest of structure, using a tight stop loss below the recent low. Your target should be based on liquidity pools, fair value gaps, or higher-timeframe imbalances. The key to trading the Power of 3 is patience and precision. Youre not trying to catch every move, but to wait for the market to complete its cycle of deception and then ride the clean expansion. Ideally, your entry comes just after manipulation, and you hold through the distributionexpansion phase, taking partials at key liquidity levels along the way. Tips for trading the PO3 1. Learn price movements Before you can effectively apply the ICT Power of 3 strategy, its crucial to have a deep understanding of how price behaves. This means being comfortable identifying market structure, recognizing trend direction, and interpreting candlestick dynamics. Since the Power of 3 is deeply rooted in how price moves in real time, a strong grasp of these basics will give you the confidence to read the market correctly as each phase develops. 2. Analyse multiple timeframes Although the Power of 3 pattern shows up on lower timeframes, relying on just one can lead to misreads. Youll gain a clearer picture when you align the short-term view with higher timeframe structure. For example, what appears to be accumulation on the 15-minute chart may simply be a retracement in a larger trend on the 1-hour or daily. By examining multiple timeframes together, you can better identify the true setup and avoid being tricked by noise. 3. Exercise patience A key part of trading the Power of 3 is knowing when to act, and more importantly, when not to. Its easy to get impatient during the accumulation or manipulation phases, but entering too early often leads to frustration or losses. True discipline comes from waiting for the expansion or distribution phase, when the market reveals its real direction. This is where the most favorable risk-to-reward setups occur.

By Matthew Frankel, CFP Updated Jan 11, 2025 at 131PM Key Points Stock market sectors group similar stocks, easing comparison and investment decisions. Sector-based ETFs and mutual funds offer a low-risk entry into specific market areas. Key sectors include Energy, Healthcare, and IT, each with distinctive leading companies. Investor Alert Our 10 best stocks to buy right now Key findings are powered by ChatGPT and based solely off the content from this article. Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content. What is a stock market sector? A stock market sector is a group of stocks that have a lot in common with each other, usually because they are in similar industries. There are 11 different stock market sectors, according to the most commonly used classification system, known as the Global Industry Classification Standard GICS. We categorize stocks into sectors to make it easy to compare companies that have similar business models. Sectors also make it easier to compare which stocks are making the most money. Image source The Motley Fool 11 sectors Investing in stock sectors At a glance, the 11 GICS stock market sectors are Energy Materials Industrials Utilities Healthcare Financials Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples Information Technology Communication Services Real Estate 1. Energy sector The energy sector covers companies that do business in the oil and natural gas industry. It includes oil and gas exploration and production companies, as well as producers of other consumable fuels like coal and ethanol. The energy sector also includes the related businesses that provide equipment, materials, and services to oil and gas producers. It doesnt include many renewable energy companies, which instead are considered utilities. Large U.S. stocks in the energy sector are ExxonMobil XOM -0.5 and Chevron CVX -1.0 . 2. Materials sector The materials sector includes companies that provide various goods for use in manufacturing and other applications. Youll find makers of chemicals , construction materials, and containers and packaging within the materials sector, along with mining stocks and companies specializing in making paper and forest products . Well-known materials stocks include paint maker Sherwin-Williams SHW 0.87 and chemicals manufacturer DuPont DD -2.48 . 3. Industrials sector The industrials sector encompasses a wide range of different businesses that generally involve the use of heavy equipment. Transportation stocks such as airlines , railroads , and logistics companies are found within the industrials sector, as are companies in the aerospace , defense , construction , and engineering industries. Companies making building products, electrical equipment, and machinery also fall into this sector, as do many conglomerates . UPS UPS -0.55 and RTX RTX 1.35 are the largest U.S. industrials stocks. 4. Utilities sector The utilities sector encompasses every different type of utility company you can imagine. Within the sector, youll find utilities specializing in making electrical power available to residential and commercial customers, as well as specialists in natural gas transmission and distribution. Other utilities are responsible for delivering water to customers. Some utility companies engage in more than one of these different subspecialties. In addition, independent producers of power and renewable electricity also land in the utilities sector, even though they dont exactly resemble the traditional regulated utility. Utilities tend to be regional in scope, so you might have heard of Duke Energy DUK 1.9 in the Southeast U.S., Consolidated Edison ED 1.21 in the Northeast, and American Electric Power AEP 0.97 across much of the Ohio Valley and the Southern Plains states. 5. Healthcare sector The healthcare sector has two primary components. One component includes companies that develop pharmaceuticals and treatments based on biotechnology , as well as the analytical tools and supplies needed for the clinical trials that test those treatments. The other encompasses healthcare equipment and services, including surgical supplies, medical diagnostic tools , and health insurance. Telemedicine is a particularly interesting part of the healthcare sector that falls into the latter category. UnitedHealth Group UNH 0.98 and Johnson Johnson JNJ 0.98 are the two stocks at the top of the healthcare sector, with a combined market cap of almost 1 trillion between them. 6. Financials sector The financials sector includes businesses that are primarily related to handling money. Banks are a key industry group within the sector, but youll also find insurance companies , brokerage houses, consumer finance providers, and mortgage-related real estate investment trusts among financials. The financial sector also includes some of the best-known financial technology, or fintech , companies. Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A -0.16 BRK.B -0.44 and financial giant JPMorgan Chase JPM -0.11 are among the best-known stocks in the financials sector. Definition Icon Fintech Fintech, short for financial technology, are a variety of software platforms, apps, and hardware solutions that leverage tech to make financial processes easier, more efficient and more profitable. 7. Consumer discretionary sector The consumer discretionary sector covers goods and services for which consumer demand depends upon consumer financial status. For example, if you make 25,000 per year, you probably buy a different car than someone who makes 25 million per year. The sector includes companies that sell higher-priced items like automobiles and luxury goods , as well as leisure products . Youll find both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce-based retail companies in this category, along with hotel and restaurant stocks. Amazon AMZN -0.31 and McDonalds MCD 0.67 are among the biggest stocks in the sector. 8. Consumer staples sector The consumer staples sector includes goods and services that consumers need, regardless of their current financial condition or the current economic climate. The category includes companies in the food , beverage , and tobacco industries , as well as household and personal care products. Youll also find retail companies that specialize in selling staples, such as grocery retailers, in this group. Coca-Cola KO 0.98 and Procter Gamble PG 0.88 are two of the most valuable consumer staples stocks in the U.S. market. 9. Information technology sector Also commonly referred to as simply the tech sector, the information technology sector covers companies involved in the different categories of technological innovation. Some companies in information technology focus on creating software or providing services related to implementing technological solutions like cybersecurity , while others are more involved in building the equipment, components, and hardware that make tech possible. Information technology also includes makers of semiconductors and the equipment used to produce semiconductor chips. Apple AAPL 0.76 and Nvidia NVDA -2.85 have been switching places at the top of the list of large U.S. stocks in the information technology sector. 10. Communication services sector The communication services sector is among the newest of the GICS sectors and includes a couple of major areas that used to be part of other sectors. Telecommunication services providers make up one wing of the sector. At the other end are media and entertainment companies, including both older media like television and radio and interactive media via the internet and newer forms of communication. Social media giant Meta META 0.49 and search engine pioneer Alphabet GOOG 0.06 L GOOG 0.06 are among the biggest stocks in communication services. 11. Real estate sector The real estate sector is the newest GICS sector, having formerly been part of the financial sector. It generally includes two different types of investments related to real estate. Some stocks in the sector are responsible for developing new real estate projects and then managing them by obtaining tenants for various spaces within the project property. In addition, most real estate investment trusts , or REITs pronounced REETS, which are special tax-favored business entities that operate in various areas of the real estate industry, get counted within the real estate sector.

A stock market sector is a group of stocks that have a lot in common with each other, usually because they are in similar industries. There are 11 different stock market sectors, according to the most commonly used classification system, known as the Global Industry Classification Standard GICS. We categorize stocks into sectors to make it easy to compare companies that have similar business models. Sectors also make it easier to compare which stocks are making the most money. Image source The Motley Fool 11 sectors Investing in stock sectors At a glance, the 11 GICS stock market sectors are Energy Materials Industrials Utilities Healthcare Financials Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples Information Technology Communication Services Real Estate 1. Energy sector The energy sector covers companies that do business in the oil and natural gas industry. It includes oil and gas exploration and production companies, as well as producers of other consumable fuels like coal and ethanol. The energy sector also includes the related businesses that provide equipment, materials, and services to oil and gas producers. It doesnt include many renewable energy companies, which instead are considered utilities. Large U.S. stocks in the energy sector are ExxonMobil XOM -0.5 and Chevron CVX -1.0 . 2. Materials sector The materials sector includes companies that provide various goods for use in manufacturing and other applications. Youll find makers of chemicals , construction materials, and containers and packaging within the materials sector, along with mining stocks and companies specializing in making paper and forest products . Well-known materials stocks include paint maker Sherwin-Williams SHW 0.87 and chemicals manufacturer DuPont DD -2.48 . 3. Industrials sector The industrials sector encompasses a wide range of different businesses that generally involve the use of heavy equipment. Transportation stocks such as airlines , railroads , and logistics companies are found within the industrials sector, as are companies in the aerospace , defense , construction , and engineering industries. Companies making building products, electrical equipment, and machinery also fall into this sector, as do many conglomerates . UPS UPS -0.55 and RTX RTX 1.35 are the largest U.S. industrials stocks. 4. Utilities sector The utilities sector encompasses every different type of utility company you can imagine. Within the sector, youll find utilities specializing in making electrical power available to residential and commercial customers, as well as specialists in natural gas transmission and distribution. Other utilities are responsible for delivering water to customers. Some utility companies engage in more than one of these different subspecialties. In addition, independent producers of power and renewable electricity also land in the utilities sector, even though they dont exactly resemble the traditional regulated utility. Utilities tend to be regional in scope, so you might have heard of Duke Energy DUK 1.9 in the Southeast U.S., Consolidated Edison ED 1.21 in the Northeast, and American Electric Power AEP 0.97 across much of the Ohio Valley and the Southern Plains states. 5. Healthcare sector The healthcare sector has two primary components. One component includes companies that develop pharmaceuticals and treatments based on biotechnology , as well as the analytical tools and supplies needed for the clinical trials that test those treatments. The other encompasses healthcare equipment and services, including surgical supplies, medical diagnostic tools , and health insurance. Telemedicine is a particularly interesting part of the healthcare sector that falls into the latter category. UnitedHealth Group UNH 0.98 and Johnson Johnson JNJ 0.98 are the two stocks at the top of the healthcare sector, with a combined market cap of almost 1 trillion between them. 6. Financials sector The financials sector includes businesses that are primarily related to handling money. Banks are a key industry group within the sector, but youll also find insurance companies , brokerage houses, consumer finance providers, and mortgage-related real estate investment trusts among financials. The financial sector also includes some of the best-known financial technology, or fintech , companies. Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A -0.16 BRK.B -0.44 and financial giant JPMorgan Chase JPM -0.11 are among the best-known stocks in the financials sector. Definition Icon Fintech Fintech, short for financial technology, are a variety of software platforms, apps, and hardware solutions that leverage tech to make financial processes easier, more efficient and more profitable. 7. Consumer discretionary sector The consumer discretionary sector covers goods and services for which consumer demand depends upon consumer financial status. For example, if you make 25,000 per year, you probably buy a different car than someone who makes 25 million per year. The sector includes companies that sell higher-priced items like automobiles and luxury goods , as well as leisure products . Youll find both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce-based retail companies in this category, along with hotel and restaurant stocks. Amazon AMZN -0.31 and McDonalds MCD 0.67 are among the biggest stocks in the sector. 8. Consumer staples sector The consumer staples sector includes goods and services that consumers need, regardless of their current financial condition or the current economic climate. The category includes companies in the food , beverage , and tobacco industries , as well as household and personal care products. Youll also find retail companies that specialize in selling staples, such as grocery retailers, in this group. Coca-Cola KO 0.98 and Procter Gamble PG 0.88 are two of the most valuable consumer staples stocks in the U.S. market. 9. Information technology sector Also commonly referred to as simply the tech sector, the information technology sector covers companies involved in the different categories of technological innovation. Some companies in information technology focus on creating software or providing services related to implementing technological solutions like cybersecurity , while others are more involved in building the equipment, components, and hardware that make tech possible. Information technology also includes makers of semiconductors and the equipment used to produce semiconductor chips. Apple AAPL 0.76 and Nvidia NVDA -2.85 have been switching places at the top of the list of large U.S. stocks in the information technology sector. 10. Communication services sector The communication services sector is among the newest of the GICS sectors and includes a couple of major areas that used to be part of other sectors. Telecommunication services providers make up one wing of the sector. At the other end are media and entertainment companies, including both older media like television and radio and interactive media via the internet and newer forms of communication. Social media giant Meta META 0.49 and search engine pioneer Alphabet GOOG 0.06 L GOOG 0.06 are among the biggest stocks in communication services. 11. Real estate sector The real estate sector is the newest GICS sector, having formerly been part of the financial sector. It generally includes two different types of investments related to real estate. Some stocks in the sector are responsible for developing new real estate projects and then managing them by obtaining tenants for various spaces within the project property. In addition, most real estate investment trusts , or REITs pronounced REETS, which are special tax-favored business entities that operate in various areas of the real estate industry, get counted within the real estate sector. Among the top stocks in the real estate sector, youll find cellular communications tower specialist American Tower AMT 0.58 and major shopping mall owner and operator Simon Property Group SPG -0.2 .
